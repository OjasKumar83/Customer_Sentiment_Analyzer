5,Crunchy & Good Gluten-Free Sandwich Cookies!,"Having tried a couple of other brands of gluten-free sandwich cookies, these are the best of the bunch.  They're crunchy and true to the texture of the other ""real"" cookies that aren't gluten-free.  Some might think that the filling makes them a bit too sweet, but for me that just means I've satisfied my sweet tooth sooner!  The chocolate version from Glutino is just as good and has a true ""chocolatey"" taste - something that isn't there with the other gluten-free brands out there.",Positive,tried couple brand glutenfree sandwich cooky best bunch theyre crunchy true texture real cooky arent glutenfree might think filling make bit sweet mean ive satisfied sweet tooth sooner chocolate version glutino good true chocolatey taste something isnt glutenfree brand
5,great kitty treats,"My cat loves these treats. If ever I can't find her in the house, I just pop the top and she bolts out of wherever she was hiding to come get a treat. She doesn't like crunchy treats much, so these are perfect for her. I've given her all three flavors and she seems to like them all equally. They do tend to dry out by the time I near the end of the bottle, however. The flip-top lid is very handy. Very nice, inexpensive kitty treats. I have yet to meet a cat that doesn't just love these!",Positive,cat love treat ever cant find house pop top bolt wherever hiding come get treat doesnt like crunchy treat much perfect ive given three flavor seems like equally tend dry time near end bottle however fliptop lid handy nice inexpensive kitty treat yet meet cat doesnt love

2,So the Mini-Wheats were too big?,"First there was Frosted Mini-Wheats, in original size, then there was Frosted Mini-Wheats Bite Size. Well, if for some reason those were too much of a mouthful, we now have Frosted Mini-Wheats Little Bits. Yes, these are about half the size of the Bite Size versions. This particular one is ""Cinnamon Roll"".<br /><br />There is nothing new to the table here with the exception of size, which I is unnecessary. Personally, I like original flavor and size the best. But the Bite Size edition were accommodating. These come off as a desperate attempt to give attention to a brand that needs some sort of life put back into it and all they came up with was making them smaller and having a new flavor, which is actually too sweet for me.<br /><br />A serving size is approximately 47 biscuits. Thats 1 gram of polyunsaturated fat, 46 grams of carbohydrates, 6g fiber, 12g of sugar, 5g of protein and 200mg of potassium. Generally they look good but I guess those that are watching their carb intake might want to be careful.<br /><br />These probably fit on a spoon better than its predecessors in a bowl of milk, but I like the other kinds cause they snack better without the milk. But here, these small ones are easily to snack more than you should.<br /><br />I am grading this product 2 stars for 3 reasons 1) I dont think making them smaller has any reason for existing outside of Kellogs filling the shelves with more versions of something that was fine to begin with. 2) This flavor, Cinnamon Roll, is sweet and has a synthetic taste to it. 3) On the plus side, I like Mini-Wheats in general, so it saved it from being one star.",Negative,first frosted miniwheats original size frosted miniwheats bite size well reason much mouthful frosted miniwheats little bit yes half size bite size version particular one cinnamon rollthere nothing new table exception size unnecessary personally like original flavor size best bite size edition accommodating come desperate attempt give attention brand need sort life put back came making smaller new flavor actually sweet mea serving size approximately biscuit thats gram polyunsaturated fat gram carbohydrate g fiber g sugar g protein mg potassium generally look good guess watching carb intake might want carefulthese probably fit spoon better predecessor bowl milk like kind cause snack better without milk small one easily snack shouldi grading product star reason dont think making smaller reason existing outside kellogs filling shelf version something fine begin flavor cinnamon roll sweet synthetic taste plus side like miniwheats general saved one star
5,Great Taste . . .,"and I want to congratulate the graphic artist for putting the entire product name on such a small box.  The ad men must have really thought long and hard.<br /><br />But seriously, I love the product. The taste was refreshing and I thought that the taste was pleasing with no aftertaste.  Not too sweet and Goldilocks would have stopped right there if there was a choice of 3.  Easy to use as you just pour the contents into a 16 oz bottle of water and shake.

4,Pretty good rice noodles,"Previously, I've attempted a recipe with white rice noodles and overcooked them, which made them soggy. So I was determined not to overcook these brown rice noodles. I tried making two dishes. The first was a miso soup with brown rice noodles, which was really just broth with miso and green onions and the noodles added when it was hot. The noodles softened and puffed up, but I think I should of softened them in water and maybe rinsed them first. The broth ended up being a little starchy from the noodles, but it was pretty good.<br /><br />The noodles by themselves don't really have any flavor, they just take on the flavor of whatever dish they are in. So the rice noodles in miso probably wasn't the best idea because the mild miso flavor didn't really give the noodles much flavor. I also tried stir frying the noodles which was much better. I just soaked the noodles in hot water, for about a minute, and then drained them. They came out clear and kind of crunchy. Then I stir fried them with garlic, onion, salt, and coconut oil. I also added some vinegar and nama shoyu for flavor. These noodles came out crunchy and spicy and actually were pretty good.<br /><br />The nice thing about these noodles is they only need about a minute in warm water and then they can be fried or added to soups or other dishes, so they are fairly versatile. They are also gluten free and the brown rice noodles seem more firm than the white rice noodles. As another reviewer posted it does look like these noodles are made in Singapore.",Positive,previously ive attempted recipe white rice noodle overcooked made soggy determined overcook brown rice noodle tried making two dish first miso soup brown rice noodle really broth miso green onion noodle added hot noodle softened puffed think softened water maybe rinsed first broth ended little starchy noodle pretty goodthe noodle dont really flavor take flavor whatever dish rice noodle miso probably wasnt best idea mild miso flavor didnt really give noodle much flavor also tried stir frying noodle much better soaked noodle hot water minute drained came clear kind crunchy stir fried garlic onion salt coconut oil also added vinegar nama shoyu flavor noodle came crunchy spicy actually pretty goodthe nice thing noodle need minute warm water fried added soup dish fairly versatile also gluten free brown rice noodle seem firm white rice noodle another reviewer posted look like noodle made singapore

4,A promising coffee!,"I am a lover of coffee and will try almost any coffee product once. I own a coffee pod maker at work, and I have been using Senseo's medium roast and espresso pods for a few months, but after trying Marley Coffee, I do not think I can go back to Senseo. I am not demeaning Senseo's quality, but I am certainly highlighting my preference for Marley Coffee. I will admit that when it comes to pod coffee, I do not expect much, and that's probably why I have stuck to only one brand; Marley Coffee, however, went beyond my expectations. I like my coffee strong; therefore, I recommend one pours no more than 6 oz. per pod for a strong flavor (this is coming from a person who drinks `straight' coffee; I never add other ingredients or sweeteners)). On a side note, there was no particular exotic/fruity taste to this coffee, but the overall quality met my expectations and passed the ""will continue to buy"" test. Other perks: it's organic, natural, and tasty, which, in my book, is worth the price.",Positive,lover coffee try almost coffee product coffee pod maker work using senseos medium roast espresso pod month trying marley coffee think go back senseo demeaning senseos quality certainly highlighting preference marley coffee admit come pod coffee expect much thats probably stuck one brand marley coffee however went beyond expectation like coffee strong therefore recommend one pours oz per pod strong flavor coming person drink straight coffee never add ingredient sweetener side note particular exoticfruity taste coffee overall quality met expectation passed continue buy test perk organic natural tasty book worth price

5,If there were any more stars to give that 5 stars...,"I would give it.  This hot sauce is the best hot sauce that has ever been made with human hands.  To compare this to Tabasco is an utter mockery, but that is the most common ""hot sauce"" that most Americans have experienced, so that is the one that I will compare it to.  Anyone that would try to genuinely compare the two should have a CAT scan done.  A 7 out of 10 as far as hotness, Tapatio can go on anything that you need to make spicy and tasty.

So far it got used to make a black rice with dried cranberry dish, very simple. Tomorrow a pumpkin curry soup, then I think a chicken curry the next day. I'm looking into making my own coconut milk so I don't have to worry about using a whole can before it goes bad, but meanwhile I am delighted with this brand in both taste and consistency.<br /><br />AND let me not forget to praise the manufacturer for resisting the temptation to add those poisons people think are preservatives (particularly sodium metabisulfite).

I asked him what was different, and he told me he used a different brand and flavor. He was really surprised that I could tell. The one that I LOVED was the Lavazza Crema e Gusto. Wow. What a difference. It's smooth and full bodied - okay, I'm full of crap. I have no idea what ""full bodied"" is other than a fat chick. But I can tell you this -- this coffee is tasty and you will not regret buying it.<br /><br />I bought it in January because there was a deal going on - $12 for 4 bricks. But here I am willing to pay $15 for 4 bricks (S&S price) less than 2 months later. I wish I had stocked up when it was cheaper, but who knew the coffee was going to be THAT GOOD!

We have been vegetarian for 12 years, so I am used to the faux meats.  Some I like, some I don't.  I LOVED Morningstar Veggie dogs, they were my absolute favorite.  Most veggie dogs in the refrigerated section of the grocery store have a ton of onion in them!  These Veja-dogs are OK on taste, but I do not like the texture.  It is A LOT like that of a hard boiled egg white.  When I first got one out of the can I did not want to even try one.  It was squishy and had tiny dark brown spots.  The syrupy stuff they are stored in really grossed me out too.  I have eaten about 5 now and am still not crazy about them.  My son however LOVES them.  He says they are his favorite.

Samson LOVES this stuff too, with the Iams I had to entice him to eat by mixing it with canned food/tablefood, but with the Canidae, he eagerly wolfs it down by itself. And why not? The first 4 ingredients are all meats- human-grade at that! Besides having less ""filler"", Canidae uses no corn products, which is good for dogs with allergies (corn is a common allergen in dogs). Some may balk at the price, but you are going to use less food per day then with the junk brands due to the high quality of indredients in this stuff. Besides, Canidae is considerably cheaper then most of the other top-shelf brands like Eagle Pack or Flint River. I'm just happy to be able to feed my dog a ""super-premium"" grade food knowing how much healthier this is for him, for just a few bucks more per bag then a mid-grade food like Iams or Pro Plan.

5,My cat loves it,"My cat loves this stuff! The nutrition is fair and it has alot of juice in the packet. It is a mixture of chunks of meat along with some shreads. It looks like real shreds of chicken. The sale price here at Amazon was awesome - less than half the price at my local stores for a whole case.<br /><br />I never have any trouble getting all of the food out of the pouch - it all slides right out. This particular flavor though for whatever reason does have a bit more product in the pouch and to make things easier when opening, I usually just cut the top off (to avoid any messes while tearing open) or, I tear from one side half way and then from the other side the rest of the way and the entire top comes off then. If there are any dribbles then, it is just a tiny bit on the side of the pouch and not on my hands at all and I do not get splattered with it. For some reason, the top usually never tears cleanly the whole way across if you try to tear it from one side only and it can be a little messy if you're in a hurry. It is not like it makes a huge mess though anyway, just a few drips here and there maybe. Cutting the top off instead of tearing it solves that though.<br /><br />The other Whiskas pouches that I like to use are the Choice Cuts varieties.

5,Great Tasting Low Salt Mix,"I recently bought some of this at a local market.  I decided to try it because for quite some time now I have purchased Morton's Light Salt to cut down on the some of the sodium I take in.  This Diamond Crystal blend is not only cheaper than the Morton's for a generous amount more, but it also taste better in my opinion.  Like the Morton's, it contains a full one third less sodium.  But where the Morton's uses the popular substitute Potassium Chloride that has a slight metallic taste to it, the main substitute ingredient in this Diamond Chrystal blend is Silicon Dioxide, which to me has a much more natural salt taste.  I prefer it over the potassium chloride, and as already mentioned, you get more for your money with this blend making it a sure deal. It took me no time at all to get used to it, and I use it in my cooking as well as in the shaker as well.  If you have trouble finding it locally, I suggest you pick it up by the case here on Amazon and you will be set for a year or more.

3,Pleasant flavor- uneven quality,"I've noticed that with a lot of products on the market today- cereals and snack items like these soynuts, the quality of the food is increasingly subpar, i.e. there are almost always a few grains or other items/detritutus in the package that should not be there. A few of these beans, for example, look like they were dried w/ tiny black spots from dirt or perhaps insects? Some might attribute this to the fact that these beans are a product of China and while I do not think that its origins are the primary source of the problem, it might explain in part the low quality of the edamame. These green babies are tasty enough although the punch of the wasabi is low. Texture is reminiscent of freeze dried food but more solid. For me, the sodium level is just about right but I happen to believe that most products are too salty and that high sodium levels may have as much to do with American's expanding waist lines as HFCS. But back to the product at hand- would I order these again? Maybe, but I am more careful about each bean I pop into my mouth now. As a highly allergy sensitive individual, I can't afford to down bad beans no matter how tiny the black dots are.",Neutral,ive noticed lot product market today cereal snack item like soynuts quality food increasingly subpar ie almost always grain itemsdetritutus package bean example look like dried w tiny black spot dirt perhaps insect might attribute fact bean product china think origin primary source problem might explain part low quality edamame green baby tasty enough although punch wasabi low texture reminiscent freeze dried food solid sodium level right happen believe product salty high sodium level may much american expanding waist line hfc back product hand would order maybe careful bean pop mouth highly allergy sensitive individual cant afford bad bean matter tiny black dot

I brewed my tea double strength and then drank it with lemonade.  Delicious and refreshing!  Even on it's own as a hot tea, it's pretty palatable.

I believe that somewhere in the process of getting to my home the Zevia Orange may be getting too hot.  It was very hot weather the first time it was shipped to me.  It really tastes weird...not like when we buy if off the shelf.  I tried again in cold weather this time and though it's not as bad, it is still no good.

5,Just what I wanted,"I very much enjoy dark roasts.  The challenge I find is that many of them are either burnt or overly bitter from poor roasting.  This coffee does a very good job of being a strong dark roast that is full of flavor without any hint of burnt or bitter flavors.  It is very dark and oily and the small portion that did not fit in my airtight container dried out a bit and was not as strong flavored.  That took over 3 weeks though due to the volume of coffee and it was still better than other dark roasts I have tried.  I have used this for guests to eat with pies and cake over the holidays and all of them commented on its excellent flavor.  A couple who don't really like dark roast did request some cream, but still gladly had multiple cups.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who:<br /><br />1.  Likes dark roast coffee<br />2.

2,Do not use this sugar for layer cakes if you intend to decorate them,"Too soft: I just used this sugar to bake one of the layers for a firm pound cake-like layer cake intended for decoration (Wilton Butter cake recipe). This is a pretty hardy cake and can stand up to changes in temperature etc and still turn out well. I had already baked several of the layers with regular granulated sugar before I ran out and decided to use some of this baking sugar. Be forewarned, this sugar makes cakes far too tender. The layer literally fell apart coming out of the pan and it was well cooled and in a pan liberally covered in cake release. Even when I was mixing the batter, it for some reason stuck to my stainless bowl and was impossible to scrape entirely out. I'm sure this is good for meringues and such, but I would never attempt to use it again for a cake or even cookies. You would never get them out of or off the pan.",Negative,soft used sugar bake one layer firm pound cakelike layer cake intended decoration wilton butter cake recipe pretty hardy cake stand change temperature etc still turn well already baked several layer regular granulated sugar ran decided use baking sugar forewarned sugar make cake far tender layer literally fell apart coming pan well cooled pan liberally covered cake release even mixing batter reason stuck stainless bowl impossible scrape entirely im sure good meringue would never attempt use cake even cooky would never get pan

5,Best Ingredients in Fancy Brand,"Flaked Fish and Shrimp most likely has the best ingredients in Fancy brand.  As another review pointed out, it's 15% more protein.  Not only that, if you look at the ingredients list, you can see ""Ocean Fish, Fish Broth, Shrimp"" at the top of the list.  The rule is that higher percentage component in the food goes first.  Having ocean fish and shrimp is great, as opposed to ""liver or meat-by-product"".  In fact, there is no meat-by-product in the list.<br /><br />Of course, it's also that my cat likes to eat this.

I loved the taste but got bored. Then I went back to my Columbian Coffee. Something still wasn't right. Now I use a 1:2 ratio of Cafe Du Monde to Columbian and haven't looked back. I cannot have my coffee any other way now. My local coffee shops rarely see my face these days because of this small orange can.<br /><br />Cafe Du Monde is coarsely grounded and has a darker brown color than most other coffees.

1,Bland tasting,"I bought this because I would buy Kirkland (Costco's brand) instant mac 'n' cheese and almost always only use the cheese powder as a quick way to make mac n cheese with my favorite pasta. When it came in the mail (quick shipping), I noticed that it has no packaging date, sell by date, or expiration date. I found that a little odd and was iffy to use it but tried it out anyway. From reading other reviews that it tasted similar to them as using store brand powdered cheese, I made my recipe with the usual amount of pasta and put an equal amount of cheese powder as the box would have. It tasted bland to me and my boyfriend. We added more powder but still nothing much. Then some salt this time and it was a TAD bit better but not much. Given the vague packaging of this product and the bland taste of the powder, I'll stick with using individual boxes of mac n cheese powder.",Negative,bought would buy kirkland costcos brand instant mac n cheese almost always use cheese powder quick way make mac n cheese favorite pasta came mail quick shipping noticed packaging date sell date expiration date found little odd iffy use tried anyway reading review tasted similar using store brand powdered cheese made recipe usual amount pasta put equal amount cheese powder box would tasted bland boyfriend added powder still nothing much salt time tad bit better much given vague packaging product bland taste powder ill stick using individual box mac n cheese powder

If I eat cereal for breakfast, even the good cereals like corn flakes or cheerios, I see a sudden spike in blood sugar and usually get tired at around 10 or 11am.  These Nature's Path Cereals, this one and the granola, are the only cereals from which I experience absolutely no negative effects.  Because of the natural ingredients, pumpkin seeds, flax, etc. this cereal does not immediately turn to sugar for the body to process.

5,Another Bias Review,"What can you possibly dislike about Puddles? Koeze's puddles are by far the most amazing puddle/turtle/bear-claw candy out there. End of story!<br /><br />Puddles are a holiday tradition in my husband's family. After a few years of rationing the small jar through January, I ordered my own box.  We've now moved on to the larger jar of milk and dark... with a few random orders throughout the year ;)  The caramel is sooo soft and delicious, the nuts are perfect, and the chocolate is a nice quality. I've never met a person who disliked puddles. The price and almost exclusively online availability aren't necessarily a selling point, but those two factors may be the only thing stopping me form living on Puddles for the rest of my life or moving into the Koeze's parking lot.  If you think I'm joking than you've obviously never eaten a Puddle.<br /><br />They can be hard to find closer to Christmas; just about everyone sells out by the 15th of December. The price is fairly consistent and most sites ship from Koeze's directly.

5,Best thing ever!!!,I grew up eating these and introduced them to my very picky five year old.  She absolutely loves them.  We moved last year and I haven't been able to find them in a store - so when I found them on Amazon I was thrilled.  I ordered them about six weeks ago (12 cans) and already need to reorder.  She ate 6 franks the first day we received them.

It's not too sugary sweet, like US chocolates tend to be.<br />2. The texture is good. Some chocolates seem a bit waxy to me, and this did, just a bit, on first taste, but that sense immediately went away.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1.

5,"Fizzy Juice, yum",The peach flavor of Knudsen Spritzers is one of their best (i also recommend strawberry and mango fandango).  The soda doesn't contain any added sugar or other undesirables.  While the main juice isn't peach juice (most of their spritzers are predominantly grape or apple juices) it does have enough peach juice to give it a distinct peach flavor.  Some people may find these spritzers a little too sweet.  I like to drink mine with ice or a little seltzer added.  I've tried other competing brands and find these spritzers the best all-juice sodas out there.,Positive,peach flavor knudsen spritzer one best also recommend strawberry mango fandango soda doesnt contain added sugar undesirable main juice isnt peach juice spritzer predominantly grape apple juice enough peach juice give distinct peach flavor people may find spritzer little sweet like drink mine ice little seltzer added ive tried competing brand find spritzer best alljuice soda
2,don't taste as good as those from the grocery store,"I'm used to buying 12 poptarts for $2.89 in my area (Tennessee) so I thought 36 for $6.70 from Amazon was a slightly better deal with the prime free shipping. Well, it would have been if the poptarts tasted fresh and as good as they do when I buy them from the grocery store. They're not packaged in tinfoil like they are at my grocery store, they just don't taste the same. They'll do and I'll eat them, but I won't be buying them from amazon again, especially since the price has increased to $18 at this writing!",Negative,im used buying poptarts area tennessee thought amazon slightly better deal prime free shipping well would poptarts tasted fresh good buy grocery store theyre packaged tinfoil like grocery store dont taste theyll ill eat wont buying amazon especially since price increased writing

One son loves the iced cookies and the other likes the plain ones -- it's great for all of us who have a variety of eaters.  My reason for one minus on the score was that the cookies arrived melted -- though it's probably my fault for ordering these in the middle 100 degree days -- keep that in mind when you are ordering.  Overall a great product and I love the snack size.  It's great that Amazon offers these items.,Positive,great product super picky family perfect one son love iced cooky like plain one great u variety eater reason one minus score cooky arrived melted though probably fault ordering middle degree day keep mind ordering overall great product love snack size great amazon offer item

4,Easier to chew and digest than rawhide,"Our elderly terrier always liked rawhide chews but she tended to gag on them and then they were difficult to digest.  She seldom enjoyed that chewing exercise.  The C.E.T. Enzymatic Oral Hygiene Chews are the perfect chewable treat for her now and the byproduct is brief moments of breath freshening.  It does not take the place of eating kibble and my brushing her teeth, but she really enjoys these chews and they are just the right size for a small dog of 13 pounds.  In the past, I purchased the larger size and cut them with heavy duty scissors, but these petite chews are fine as is.  Unlike rawhide chews, these are consumed rather quickly and don't require the strongest of teeth, so they are much better for older dogs who still like to chew.  I think they are a little pricy, so I look for special values which occasionally occur on Amazon, always much better than the price at the vet.",Positive,elderly terrier always liked rawhide chew tended gag difficult digest seldom enjoyed chewing exercise cet enzymatic oral hygiene chew perfect chewable treat byproduct brief moment breath freshening take place eating kibble brushing teeth really enjoys chew right size small dog pound past purchased larger size cut heavy duty scissors petite chew fine unlike rawhide chew consumed rather quickly dont require strongest teeth much better older dog still like chew think little pricy look special value occasionally occur amazon always much better price vet

4,Yummy,"I bought these caramels because I needed a treat that is individually wrapped (they stand along side Jolly Ranchers and Starbursts!)  They taste great; creamy and delicious.  If caramels run into a problem it's generally that they're too hard and chewy.  Not these caramels!  Not sure what else can be said about their actual taste.  All is as it should be.<br /><br />Each caramel is approximately 3/4"" x 3/4"" x 1/2"" and the entire 5 pound bag displaces approximately 1.5 gallons of space.<br /><br />They arrived in a rectangle flat box sealed in a plastic bag with a label that has a bar code (X0003AQ51L) and the text ""Caramel Squares 5lb"" and ""New"", though no date... This is the reason for the one star deduction as I believe nutritional info, ingredients, born on/exp date should have been provided.<br /><br />Seems a good product, a pity the seller didn't do more to stand beside it.",Positive,bought caramel needed treat individually wrapped stand along side jolly rancher starbursts taste great creamy delicious caramel run problem generally theyre hard chewy caramel sure else said actual taste beeach caramel approximately x x entire pound bag displaces approximately gallon spacethey arrived rectangle flat box sealed plastic bag label bar code xaql text caramel square lb new though date reason one star deduction believe nutritional info ingredient born onexp date providedseems good product pity seller didnt stand beside

2,Bad Batch,"I think I received a bad batch( there's no expiration date).  Tried one---made me a bit queasy afterwards; like a fool I tried another( a few days later), this time w/o the mustard/mayo, and felt sick again.  These have probably been sitting on the shelf in a sweltering warehouse for quite some time, which can't be good for the mustard/mayo or the oily soy sauce pack.  That aside, they don't taste too bad actually but nowhere near as good as the other reviews would suggest.  I ordered a couple other Myojo ramen and they seemed fine, so I'm guessing it's just the luck of the draw---ordering food products from Amazon is something of a crapshoot( I've had stale popcorn delivered too).",Negative,think received bad batch there expiration date tried onemade bit queasy afterwards like fool tried another day later time wo mustardmayo felt sick probably sitting shelf sweltering warehouse quite time cant good mustardmayo oily soy sauce pack aside dont taste bad actually nowhere near good review would suggest ordered couple myojo ramen seemed fine im guessing luck drawordering food product amazon something crapshoot ive stale popcorn delivered
4,Better than expected,"After recently discovering a gluten intolerance I have been struggling to find things that I can take for lunch that actually satisfy my hunger.  I have tried other gluten free products and have been disappointed with quite a few.  These crackers were a pleasant surprise.  Many in the package were broken when they arrived, but that does not make them inedible.  I think they break so easily due to the fact that they are ""dry"" in texture.  Keep this in mind when buying and make sure to top these crackers with cheese or some other type of spread.",Positive,recently discovering gluten intolerance struggling find thing take lunch actually satisfy hunger tried gluten free product disappointed quite cracker pleasant surprise many package broken arrived make inedible think break easily due fact dry texture keep mind buying make sure top cracker cheese type spread

5,Yummy In My Tummy,Last time I ate ramen was when I was a 16 yrs old and even then I didn't care for them much (but in a pinch was a quick meal). I bought a whole bunch of noodles for my nephew who is in college and seeing the prices these were going for I HAD to try them myself.  I prepared it as instructed in the packaging. Only difference is I only used half of the seasonings packet. I always found seasoning packets too salty for my taste ( I also never drink the left over broth saves both calories and sodium) . I also shredded a left over jerk chicken breast from last night. I must say it was very good. The noodles went great with it. Next time I will add some frozen mixed veggies as well. All in all I am quite surprised and pleased with these. I know I can have them on hand for the occasional meal when I am not feeling well enough to cook a full meal.,Positive,last time ate ramen yr old even didnt care much pinch quick meal bought whole bunch noodle nephew college seeing price going try prepared instructed packaging difference used half seasoning packet always found seasoning packet salty taste also never drink left broth save calorie sodium also shredded left jerk chicken breast last night must say good noodle went great next time add frozen mixed veggie well quite surprised pleased know hand occasional meal feeling well enough cook full meal

4,"Excellent quality, but may be a bit too strong.","With hundreds (if not thousands) of coffee brands and/or types, it's tough to choose one, especially online without tasting.  I took a shot at Community Coffee's whole-bean French Roast.  I bought a Hamilton Beach coffee bean grinder, so I refuse to buy pre-ground coffee.  Psychologically, doing so would negate the value that the coffee-bean grinder would provide to me.<br /><br />With that aside, 2 of the 3 bags of coffee that came in the package were shrink-wrapped, meaning that you could see the shapes of the coffee beans through the package since it was vacuum sealed.  The other package was loose, like you'd see at your typical grocery store. I'm pretty sure it didn't effect the quality of the brew, but it's just something that I noticed.<br /><br />Moving on to the bottom line here: the coffee tastes good, but might be too strong for some.  I'm used to good 'ole McDonald's coffee, which to me, is decent.  I like Peet's and various Sumatra blends from Coffee Bean and Starbucks, but herein lies the issue with choosing coffee: how do you know how strong a particular coffee is going to be?  A solid solution would be to rate the coffee on a scale of 1-10, 1 being weak and 10 being super-strong.  In using this guideline, I'd rate this coffee a 10 in terms of strength.  It's great early in the morning when you need a quick jolt of caffeine, but not-so-good in the afternoon or evening.<br /><br />Anyhow, this was worth a shot...I plan on ordering more Community Coffee, just a weaker blend.",Positive,hundred thousand coffee brand andor type tough choose one especially online without tasting took shot community coffee wholebean french roast bought hamilton beach coffee bean grinder refuse buy preground coffee psychologically would negate value coffeebean grinder would provide mewith aside bag coffee came package shrinkwrapped meaning could see shape coffee bean package since vacuum sealed package loose like youd see typical grocery store im pretty sure didnt effect quality brew something noticedmoving bottom line coffee taste good might strong im used good ole mcdonalds coffee decent like peets various sumatra blend coffee bean starbucks herein lie issue choosing coffee know strong particular coffee going solid solution would rate coffee scale weak superstrong using guideline id rate coffee term strength great early morning need quick jolt caffeine notsogood afternoon eveninganyhow worth shoti plan ordering community coffee weaker blend

5,Healthy substitute for peanut butter,"I just got my PB2 in the mail today, and I was very curious as to how it would taste. I was pleasantly surprised! No, it does not taste as good as peanut butter, but considering it has 85% less fat, it is pretty darn good! I'm on Weight Watchers and I'm always trying to find substitutions to stick to my points. 2 tbsp of PB2 is equal to 1 Weight Watcher's Points Plus point. 2 tbsp of full fat peanut butter is 5 points. However, 2 tbsp of PB2 does not equal 2 tbsp of peanut paste, so you have to keep that in mind. It would probably take about 3 tbsp of PB2 to get 2 full tbsp of paste. Anyways, I added 2 tbsp of PB2 to a Jell-O pudding cup (the sugar free), and it was delicious! It tasted like a Reese's Cup. I was able to add some protein and flavor to my dessert, and the entire thing was 3 points. PB2 does have a bit of a gritty consistency like protein powder, but it didn't bother me. I'm not sure I would eat this off of the spoon, but I will definitely use it in PB&J sandwiches, shakes and other recipes for peanut butter flavor.  I read somewhere that mixing it with Greek yogurt is very good as a protein-packed fruit dip.",Positive,got pb mail today curious would taste pleasantly surprised taste good peanut butter considering less fat pretty darn good im weight watcher im always trying find substitution stick point tbsp pb equal weight watcher point plus point tbsp full fat peanut butter point however tbsp pb equal tbsp peanut paste keep mind would probably take tbsp pb get full tbsp paste anyways added tbsp pb jello pudding cup sugar free delicious tasted like reeses cup able add protein flavor dessert entire thing point pb bit gritty consistency like protein powder didnt bother im sure would eat spoon definitely use pbj sandwich shake recipe peanut butter flavor read somewhere mixing greek yogurt good proteinpacked fruit dip

2,Not A Good Espresso Substitute but OK for Rooibos Chai,"I am an avid tea drinker who turned to the drink after realizing my body can't really tolerate coffee. I enjoy Rooibos on occasion and use it for chai when serving to people who are sensative to caffine.<br /><br />One important point about Rooibos is that it isn't technically tea it doesn't come from the Camellia Sinensis fmaily and therefore is considered an herbal.  It's a common mistake to label things which aren't true tea as teas, but a bigger mistake would be to label this ""espresso"".<br /><br />The only thing Red Espresso has in common with Espresso (aside from how you may chose to prepare it) is how it is ground.  When dealing with herbals and teas the more surface area that the water has contact with when you brew it, the more bitter the resulting beverage. With Red Espresso, rather than getting a sweet and clean tasting beverage, that you'd get from traditionally prepared rooibos, you get one which is much more bitter and sharp.<br /><br />I tried preparing this tea a number of different ways and found it took a lot to get the water to grounds ratio right. With only one exception I was never quite pleased with the resulting beverage.  The best luck I had with Red Espresso was to put it on the stovetop in water and then add chai spices to the mix, drain through a strainer and then adding milk and sweetner.<br /><br />I recognize people will turn to products like this for the health benefits, but I think they'll be disappointed with the experience of drinking this like coffee. For a much better coffee substitute I recommend Choffy which approximates the taste of coffee much closer.<br /><br />But if you're looking to give up your regular cup-o-joe for tea, this isn't the way to go. You'd be much better served picking up some Yunnan Gold or an Assam black tea, brewing it strong and adding milk and sweetener (if desired). If you're set on rooibos then look for the full unground needles to use to brew a much more pleasant cup.",Negative,avid tea drinker turned drink realizing body cant really tolerate coffee enjoy rooibos occasion use chai serving people sensative caffineone important point rooibos isnt technically tea doesnt come camellia sinensis fmaily therefore considered herbal common mistake label thing arent true tea tea bigger mistake would label espressothe thing red espresso common espresso aside may chose prepare ground dealing herbal tea surface area water contact brew bitter resulting beverage red espresso rather getting sweet clean tasting beverage youd get traditionally prepared rooibos get one much bitter sharpi tried preparing tea number different way found took lot get water ground ratio right one exception never quite pleased resulting beverage best luck red espresso put stovetop water add chai spice mix drain strainer adding milk sweetneri recognize people turn product like health benefit think theyll disappointed experience drinking like coffee much better coffee substitute recommend choffy approximates taste coffee much closerbut youre looking give regular cupojoe tea isnt way go youd much better served picking yunnan gold assam black tea brewing strong adding milk sweetener desired youre set rooibos look full unground needle use brew much pleasant cup
4,"MUCH better than dried herbs but not as good as fresh, of course","I purchased one variety of this product at a local gourmet grocery store (this review is for the Italian Herb mix.)  I cook with fresh herbs regularly and thought that I would give this a shot.  Overall, I am glad that I did.<br /><br />First, if you are looking for a fresh taste nothing can beat herbs that were picked as recently as possible.  However, there are times when it is impractical to pick or purchase freshly picked herbs. Also, if you are just looking for a garnish this blend with work well and taste better than it's dried counterpart.<br /><br />It is true that the herbs were a little stuck together when I first opened the box.  I stuck a small, escargot fork through the opening and they loosened up just fine.  I had no other problem with clumping throughout the life of the product.<br /><br />The Italian blend had a nice, bright flavor. The chlorophyll was still present and strong.  Again, no substitute for fresh but better than using dried herbs when the recipe calls for fresh (it's great in sauces, by the way.)  However, if a recipe calls for dried herbs you will need a lot more of this mix since fresh herbs are not as concentrated as dry.<br /><br />I have not used this company's other products but I plan on buying them sometime in the future and I will update this review then.",Positive,purchased one variety product local gourmet grocery store review italian herb mix cook fresh herb regularly thought would give shot overall glad didfirst looking fresh taste nothing beat herb picked recently possible however time impractical pick purchase freshly picked herb also looking garnish blend work well taste better dried counterpartit true herb little stuck together first opened box stuck small escargot fork opening loosened fine problem clumping throughout life productthe italian blend nice bright flavor chlorophyll still present strong substitute fresh better using dried herb recipe call fresh great sauce way however recipe call dried herb need lot mix since fresh herb concentrated dryi used company product plan buying sometime future update review

2,not for me,"I've never had Finn Crisp (any flavor) or other crispbreads before. Pretty happy with the taste of traditional crackers (I can eat a lot of them without toppings). Just starting to explore the crispbread space (after reading about it in a health magazine), hoping for a healthier snack, especially something lower in sodium. I tried Ryvita (can't remember what flavor, but it is the sodium free one), and it tastes like cardboard. I couldn't find Finn Crisp at any of my local stores. So I ended up ordering it from Amazon, for a pack of 9. I was brave enough to do that because of all the good reviews.<br /><br />As soon as the shipment arrived, I made everyone in my family try one. Thumbs down from everyone, including myself. Makes me wonder why the magazine people say this crispbread can go topless, and why pretty much everyone who wrote a review think this stuff tastes good. To me, it has a faint bitter taste; to some of my family, it is tasteless. I can eat it, but certainly not something I can say I like. So spending 40+ mg of sodium per slice on this is not worth it.<br /><br />Well, I think I will go back to the cardboard taste Ryvita. At least it is sodium free, and I can buy just 1 box from a local store, not a pack through mail order. Personally, I prefer the cardboard taste to this faintly bitter taste.",Negative,ive never finn crisp flavor crispbreads pretty happy taste traditional cracker eat lot without topping starting explore crispbread space reading health magazine hoping healthier snack especially something lower sodium tried ryvita cant remember flavor sodium free one taste like cardboard couldnt find finn crisp local store ended ordering amazon pack brave enough good reviewsas soon shipment arrived made everyone family try one thumb everyone including make wonder magazine people say crispbread go topless pretty much everyone wrote review think stuff taste good faint bitter taste family tasteless eat certainly something say like spending mg sodium per slice worth itwell think go back cardboard taste ryvita least sodium free buy box local store pack mail order personally prefer cardboard taste faintly bitter taste

Instead of crisp, oily and full of character...say as if they were cooked in like...a kettle or something they instead have the color and uniformity of baked lays.  The Spicy Thai flavor now tastes like sour cream and onion or ranch that has gone rancid.<br /><br />What a shame, no more kettle chips for me.

5,great brand of stevia in convenient tablets,":: SteviaTabs Stevia Extract Tablets, Pack of Four 100-Count Packages ::<br /><br />I am hooked on always taking my coffee with stevia.

I take a packet with me for when I am away from home (travel, motels, etc).<br /><br />Another good reason for choosing tablets that I learned from experience:<br /><br />I was trying to get a friend to switch to stevia for his coffee instead of the chemical whatever-it-was sweetener tabs that were his habit. He reported that the stevia was far too intenseley sweet. I was suprised, but then after further dialogue, learned that it was because when he used the shaker jar, he poured in too much. Since then I found that setting a stevia-newbie up with tablets, and the simple instructions of 1-2 tabs per cup, it's what makes for the best approach.<br /><br />Note! Amzn's current price on these, less than $4 per pack, it is VERY good. I spent a lot of time last winter researching lowest possible price on this product.

They have not been partial to canned foods, nor have I often gone the canned food route because it is less than convenient and didn't seem worth the candle since they seem to favor dry food (and mice and birds and whatever else they can glean from our little acre in the woods).  They typically start out loving canned food, but after a few bites, the rest sits in the bowl and dries out before we toss it and go back to the dry food they've grown to love.<br /><br />However, both of our cats are smitten by this stuff.  It looks like real food out of the can, with large chunks of fish and seafood in a thickened broth.  It doesn't have the strong fishy smell of most canned foods and looks like something I could almost be tempted to eat my self in a pinch.  The 3 ounce size makes it perfect for a ""treat"" for the cats between feedings of dry food and they leave nothing behind when we dump a can in their dish (with some added hot water as they really love the broth).<br /><br />But I'm not sure I want my cats eating this stuff for the same reason I don't want my eight year old eating at fast food franchises, much as she might love the food and snarf it up in a flash -- I'm concerned this food may not be a healthy thing for the animal eating it or for the planet. Seeing ""Made in Thailand"" emblazoned on the box made me immediately wonder whether this stuff might include ingredients banned in the US or could otherwise be manufactured without adequate regulation of methods and materials.  The Chinese pet food fiasco certainly came to mind.<br /><br />The discussions of other reviewers about the menadione used in this product confirms my concern.  I'm also left to wonder about the source of the fish and seafood in these cans -- is it farm raised in Thailand and if so under what conditions; is it wild fish that may be subject to overfishing and at the very least ought to be feeding hungry humanity rather than going down my cats' gullets; what about mercury and other contaminants in the food?<br /><br />Bottom line: my cats seem to love the stuff, but I'm not sure that will be sufficient to convince me to buy it again.",Neutral,variety pack came u amazon vine program sample two cat living various high end dry cat food time eg grain food chicken tuna salmon version fancy pantsy duck lorange stuff local pet shop partial canned food often gone canned food route less convenient didnt seem worth candle since seem favor dry food mouse bird whatever else glean little acre wood typically start loving canned food bite rest sits bowl dry toss go back dry food theyve grown lovehowever cat smitten stuff look like real food large chunk fish seafood thickened broth doesnt strong fishy smell canned food look like something could almost tempted eat self pinch ounce size make perfect treat cat feeding dry food leave nothing behind dump dish added hot water really love brothbut im sure want cat eating stuff reason dont want eight year old eating fast food franchise much might love food snarf flash im concerned food may healthy thing animal eating planet seeing made thailand emblazoned box made immediately wonder whether stuff might include ingredient banned u could otherwise manufactured without adequate regulation method material chinese pet food fiasco certainly came mindthe discussion reviewer menadione used product confirms concern im also left wonder source fish seafood can farm raised thailand condition wild fish may subject overfishing least ought feeding hungry humanity rather going cat gullet mercury contaminant foodbottom line cat seem love stuff im sure sufficient convince buy

5,Good food for English bulldog,We just switched our English Bulldog from bulldog food to this food because she has a bad rash and we can't seem to get rid of it. The person that sold us the dog recommended it. I don't really think it was caused from her food but everyone tells me to switch her food so we are trying this out.  The only thing I don't like too much about this food is that the pieces are quite small and harder for my dog to pick up so they get all over the floor.  She seems to be eating it and we will have to wait and see what happens.  Everything I read about caring for an English Bulldog seems to point to food for everything and this looks like it should be good for our dog.,Positive,switched english bulldog bulldog food food bad rash cant seem get rid person sold u dog recommended dont really think caused food everyone tell switch food trying thing dont like much food piece quite small harder dog pick get floor seems eating wait see happens everything read caring english bulldog seems point food everything look like good dog

4,Good if you like Coffee,"This coffee is moderate in flavor (not to weak, not too strong) and I would recommend it to coffee drinkers who want a flavor in that range. It is ""coffee flavored coffee"", in other words, no fancy flavoring. Being organic, it is (hopefully) sans all of the nasty chemicals that tend to get added. I want to note I used it unconventionally. I cut the packets open and ran it through a regular coffee maker. Five packets for a 12 cup pot. Came out just fine doing that. If you're looking for organic coffee, this one will do nicely.<br /><br />My only real issue is the packets do not have an easy open to get the little coffee bag out. I had to use scissors.

3,If you like cloves...,"First time I tried Stash Chai Spice Black Tea, I hated it.  Something about the smell did not appeal to me.  It inspired me to go to the local Indian grocer and purchase my own spices to make chai from scratch.  That was very successful (with help from the Internet and advice from an Indian friend).  I finally came back to try Stash's Chai again today and the first thing that hit me was the strong clove scent, which doesn't bother me as much after a few minutes.  I think the chai tastes a bit better this time around than when I first tried it.  Kinda grows on you, I guess.  However, it's not GREAT chai by any means.  It's okay for chai in a teabag.  Convenient.  But I'll stick to making it from scratch when I finally finish this box (waste not).",Neutral,first time tried stash chai spice black tea hated something smell appeal inspired go local indian grocer purchase spice make chai scratch successful help internet advice indian friend finally came back try stash chai today first thing hit strong clove scent doesnt bother much minute think chai taste bit better time around first tried kinda grows guess however great chai mean okay chai teabag convenient ill stick making scratch finally finish box waste

Rest assured, they were Zabiha halal.<br /><br />As to the product: the taste of this type of candy is initially sweet due to the granulated sugar after which you begin to taste the flat-cola type of flavor.

5,"The Best Money can Buy for your Cat, Next to Homemade - Revised for Turkey","I like to provide variety for the cats, however, I like to stick with single protein sources.  So in addition to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFORH0"">Wellness Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats, Chicken Formula (Pack of 12 12.5 Ounce Cans)</a>, I also get this one to add on with a higher protein diet.<br /><br />I have 3 cats, one is now 17 years old.

The below feeding schedule is modified slightly (sometimes only two feedings a day, maybe half the amount of dry, etc.)  If your cat has a sensitive tummy, it is best to feed more frequent, smaller meals each day.<br /><br />The 7 and 13 yo boys get about 1/4 cup dry per day.<br />The 17 yo girl gets about 1/8 cup dry per day.<br /><br />I then split one can between all three twice a day.  When the can is first opened, I add little hot water to the wet food.  This guarantees a consistent texture between different batches,  The remainder of the can is covered with a plastic lid, and placed in the refrigerator.  I then later pull out (don't leave in fridge for more than 2 days), separate into three servings, and mix at least 1/8 cup hot water.

5,Addictive,"These are the best potato chips I've ever tasted.  It's easy to go through half of a bag without stopping.  The texture/crunchiness is just perfect, as is the salt and vinegar combination.  I don't know how they taste so much better than all of the other chips I've ever had, but they do.  And, judging from the nutrition facts, they seem to be healthier, too.  They're somewhat fibrous and have a good bit of potassium and vitamin c, which could be because they don't skin the potatoes and the chips are a bit thicker than normal.<br /><br />And if you like these, all of the Kettle chips are great.",Positive,best potato chip ive ever tasted easy go half bag without stopping texturecrunchiness perfect salt vinegar combination dont know taste much better chip ive ever judging nutrition fact seem healthier theyre somewhat fibrous good bit potassium vitamin c could dont skin potato chip bit thicker normaland like kettle chip great

3,"Okay tasting, expensive, not into the hype of agave","When agave first came on the scene I thought it sounded great.  But after a lot more research I don't think it's the wonder sweetener that many people think it is.  It is VERY high in (processed) fructose, not the same as fructose found in natural fruit.  Fructose is metabolized directly by the liver, which is different from other sugars, and can lead to fatty liver deposits. High fructose intake has also been linked to weight gain, insulin resistance, and heart disease risk in animal studies.<br /><br />Also, at the Amazon price this is extremely expensive.  My favorite is a 2 oz. bottle of NuNaturals No Alcohol Liquid Stevia--it mixes instantly in beverages, is not bitter, and lasts forever.",Neutral,agave first came scene thought sounded great lot research dont think wonder sweetener many people think high processed fructose fructose found natural fruit fructose metabolized directly liver different sugar lead fatty liver deposit high fructose intake also linked weight gain insulin resistance heart disease risk animal studiesalso amazon price extremely expensive favorite oz bottle nunaturals alcohol liquid steviait mix instantly beverage bitter last forever

3,Fastachi Belgian Marzipan,"Although this product arrived quickly and well-packaged, it was not the best tasting marzipan that I have ever had.  To be fair, however, it was not the worst I've had either.  My main complaint is that there was little almond flavor to the pieces, which is, of course, the reason you buy marzipan!

5,"Hot Damn, This Is GREAT!","I pondered buying this product for days because of mixed reviews, many concerning the size of the ginger. I feel for those people who got scraps, but in my 24-pack I received pretty uniform cubes of a VERY good size. This is, hands down, the best crystallized ginger I've ever had except for once... and that was home-made in Hong Kong.<br /><br />First, the chunks are just the right size to be tender and sweet without being too large to enjoy as a snack. The quality of the ginger is outstanding, with a deep, fresh flavor and just the right amount of sugar. The color is a light gold, and the texture lacks the fibrous strands of mature ginger that too much crystallized ginger is made from. So, they say baby ginger, and I can attest, it must be. Because of that, the flavor is strong without being an overpowering heat, but the heat is there. I'd place it on the mild end of the ginger spectrum, which works for me, but if you want fire this isn't for you. This is one of two crystallized gingers I'd recommend, and the other is the fiery one (Reed's), but this has the better overall flavor of ginger.<br /><br />This is definitely ginger for snacking; if you want to bake with this you could, but you'd definitely need to get busy with the knife-work. If you're looking for dried ginger, this isn't that either... this is fresh, tender, and sweet-heat ginger. For tea... I could see mashing a cube or two and making something pretty terrific, but I'd probably end up eating it straight. I'm gong to buy some of the baking cut (small nuggets) for ginger snaps now, because if they're using the same ginger it's going to be amazing.<br /><br />Bottom line: while it's possible that some people received a bad package with small pieces, in 24 packs I saw minimal variation in size, and nothing I'd describe as too large or small. This is fresh as hell, not too sugared, and the quality of the ginger is out of this world. If you like ginger, I'd find it hard to imagine not falling in love with this.",Positive,pondered buying product day mixed review many concerning size ginger feel people got scrap pack received pretty uniform cube good size hand best crystallized ginger ive ever except homemade hong kongfirst chunk right size tender sweet without large enjoy snack quality ginger outstanding deep fresh flavor right amount sugar color light gold texture lack fibrous strand mature ginger much crystallized ginger made say baby ginger attest must flavor strong without overpowering heat heat id place mild end ginger spectrum work want fire isnt one two crystallized ginger id recommend fiery one reed better overall flavor gingerthis definitely ginger snacking want bake could youd definitely need get busy knifework youre looking dried ginger isnt either fresh tender sweetheat ginger tea could see mashing cube two making something pretty terrific id probably end eating straight im gong buy baking cut small nugget ginger snap theyre using ginger going amazingbottom line possible people received bad package small piece pack saw minimal variation size nothing id describe large small fresh hell sugared quality ginger world like ginger id find hard imagine falling love
5,"Unique product, well executed","The flavor of these nuts is similar to cinnamon toast cereal, yet they are filling and healthy, containing little sugar and almost no salt. I would deduct a star for being priced too high both here and in the supermarket, but Blue Diamond deserves credit for their restraint in using quality ingredients and in not producing a sugar encrusted candy. Now if they would only go against the trend of charging a huge markup for minimal extra processing cost...<br /><br />The other reviewer seems to think these contain lactose.

5,a nutritional shake that tastes good?,"You know, it's been a while since I've had a nutritional shake or protein drink.  When I took a fitness course in college I tried a whole bunch of different kinds... which all tasted like chalk to me. I would hold my breath and try not to gag or throw up. So because of that awful experience, I vowed to never again drink nutritional shakes.  Then Amazon came along and offered a free sample to review. I still was reluctant but decided to face my fear. Plus, I really need to get back into shape again :) The fact that it was called a ""shake"" and not a ""protein drink"" made me more hopeful. So, when I finally took my first swig of it today I was pleasantly surprised. Yeah, it actually tastes good... not to be confused with ""bearable"". It actually tastes like a nice strawberry smoothy.<br /><br />Now, I don't know exactly how good it is for you... since it tastes so good. So I can't comment on it's actual ""nutritional value"".  Oh, by the way, I drank the strawberry flavored one. So I don't know how good the other flavors are yet. One last thing to keep in mind is that it does contain Milk protein.. so if you're lactose intolerant, you may want to drink something else.  It also means you have to refrigerate it after opening.  I hope this review was helpful... bottoms up! :)",Positive,know since ive nutritional shake protein drink took fitness course college tried whole bunch different kind tasted like chalk would hold breath try gag throw awful experience vowed never drink nutritional shake amazon came along offered free sample review still reluctant decided face fear plus really need get back shape fact called shake protein drink made hopeful finally took first swig today pleasantly surprised yeah actually taste good confused bearable actually taste like nice strawberry smoothynow dont know exactly good since taste good cant comment actual nutritional value oh way drank strawberry flavored one dont know good flavor yet one last thing keep mind contain milk protein youre lactose intolerant may want drink something else also mean refrigerate opening hope review helpful bottom

Peppermint is one of the most enjoyable herbal teas with a naturally sweet, clean taste.<br /><br />Peppermint is an herb that has many uses in traditional herbal medicine. It is reputed to relax the muscles of the digestive system which helps relieve nausea. Peppermint combats flatulence, promotes bile flow and digestive juices, and has a mildly anesthetic effect which also eases indigestion.

1,Gerber's fruits are cooked,"I've been giving my daughter Gerber fruits, veggies, and meat as everyday-meals since she was 6 months old, thinking that she's got enough vitamins and prebiotics.

I took her to GI and she told me that those packed fruits are all cooked! And there are additives to keep them fresh for long period of time!

5,Are We Reviewing Our Mistakes Or These Cookies?,"Wow.  So far, two two-star reviews.  One obviously had no idea what they were ordering; the other wants crispy cookies.  Hey, I'm sorry; but these reviews do nobody any good beyond reminding us to look  before ordering.<br /><br />These are chocolate-oatmeal cookies.  If you don't like that combination, don't order this type of cookie.  I find the combo quite nice, really.  The oatmeal sort of ""calms"" the rich chocolate flavor and gives the cookie sort of a coconut-type consistency.  Now let's also remember that tastes differ; so, I've given my opinion.<br /><br />Then, these are soft, chewy cookies -- as advertised.  They are not ""crispy"" cookies, or the blurb would say ""crispy,"" rather than ""chewy.""  I happen to like raw cookie dough; however, I don't see where these taste like raw cookie dough.  Both are soft, however, so is this the confusion?  And, yes, they stick together.  Soft cookies tend to do that.  They aren't individually wrapped, which would add to the cost.  Oh yeah, chocolate chip cookies tend to be somewhat sweet.<br /><br />So, if you want something hard and crisp, I suggest Nabiso's Ginger Snaps.  If you want a cookie that's soft, chewy and tastes like a combination of chocolate and oatmeal, give these a try.

Erin's Baker's breakfast cookies is the result of this search. With a good 300 calories, these cookies provides you with a good balance of calories and the needed nutrients (especially coming from the whole grains) while at the same time being a pleasurable eating experience. I have not tasted anything other than the double chocolate chunk, however I can safely say these did not disappoint.

There are a variety of root vegetable chips in each bag (varies based on what flavor you buy). I like all the veggie chips I've had, though some are harder than others. Terra chips have a great texture--crunchy like regular potato chips rather than soft and chewy like most dried fruits/veggies.

I feed my dog to keep her healthy, was NOT prepared to kill her as I feed her.  She is on meds and a Healthy Pet food now.

5,Great enough to eat plain!,"Sure you could put it in milk and eat it like cereal, sprinkle it as a topping on ice cream or fro-yo, but it is perfect enough to snack right out of the bag.  I love how sweet it is.  I am not a fan of dry-barely-sweet granola but the gooey sugary stuff marketed toward children isn't great either (I'd rather eat a cookie or cake).  This hits that midpoint that is perfect when craving a sweet snack (without going for a full-fledged dessert).  The chocolate is perfect and sweet without being bitter like found in many healthier snacks.<br /><br />Nice perk... the zipper closure at the top.  I can never seem to find a ""Chip Clip"" in my house when I need one though I have bought dozens.",Positive,sure could put milk eat like cereal sprinkle topping ice cream froyo perfect enough snack right bag love sweet fan drybarelysweet granola gooey sugary stuff marketed toward child isnt great either id rather eat cookie cake hit midpoint perfect craving sweet snack without going fullfledged dessert chocolate perfect sweet without bitter like found many healthier snacksnice perk zipper closure top never seem find chip clip house need one though bought dozen
5,Love it!,"Our family eats at Taco Bell on the rare occasion, and I've never been a big fan of their food.  Their sauces on the other hand, I've always liked.  And not only is it cheaper and better quality ingredients to make your own tacos for your family, but now you can have the awesome sauces, too.  I really like this one quite a bit.  It's got a little bit of a kick to it, and it's my husband's favorite.<br /><br />A little bit does go along way, and I cannot imagine anyone using the ""serving size"" of 2 tablespoons!  A teaspoon per taco is MORE than enough.  And I like it that way, that you get plenty of value out of the bottle.  Will definitely buy again, and will buy other flavors as well.",Positive,family eats taco bell rare occasion ive never big fan food sauce hand ive always liked cheaper better quality ingredient make taco family awesome sauce really like one quite bit got little bit kick husband favoritea little bit go along way imagine anyone using serving size tablespoon teaspoon per taco enough like way get plenty value bottle definitely buy buy flavor well
5,Great Instant Sugar Free Cider,"I am surprised by the negative reviews here.  I mean, instant cider (the kind you get in the packets) will never taste like real cider.  This is actually better than the brands of instant cider I have found.  Yes, it is sweet, and the caramel ""finish"" is a nice addition.  This is the only K-Cup product I have found that is sugar free, which I appreciate.

5,Clean and tasty beverage.,"I feel like straight coconut water is an acquired taste, but these peach mango ones are just delicious. They aren't too sweet and the mix of peach and mango is more of an accent than a dominant set of flavors. The result is a cool, refreshing beverage in what i consider to be the perfect container size. Where i live, these are priced individually at an average of $1.79, which would be around $21.50 for a twelve pack. So, for the current subscribe & save price of $17.65, you are saving around $4 here on Amazon (if you would have purchased twelve anyway that is).<br />Great taste, competitive price.

5,Best meal time slower-downer and doggy activity out there,"We bought this for our 5 month old lab to keep her from inhaling her dinner in 5 seconds flat. We have now purchased 2 more as gifts for other dog owners.<br /><br />It took our dog a day and a half to figure this toy out. At first she barked at it since she was frustrated that she could see and smell her kibble but couldn't get to it. After a few happy mistakes with pawing at it and watching us pull the rope, she caught on. Now it takes her 20 minutes to eat her 1.5 cups of kibble inside.<br /><br />Great Features:<br />- Durable and easy to wash Nalgene type material<br />- ""Rope"" is actually a flexible rubber stick, making washing/sanitizing easy<br />- Screw-off bottom makes loading up the toy simple<br />- Translucent bottle so you can see how much kibble is left<br />- Can hold all sorts of sizes of kibble<br /><br />Challenging Feature:<br />- It can sometimes take a few tries to get the bottom screwed back on b/c the threads are narrow. But, then again the bottom has never fallen off and the dog can't figure out how to unscrew the bottom.<br /><br />We had tried other 'treat balls' in the past, but found that they couldn't hold enough kibble to keep the activity going for very long. Other treat ball products were either to big or small for our dog's kibble, making getting the food out either way too easy (it fell right out) or too hard (it took a human with thumbs to get it out). Finally, the other treat balls were a solid rubber which meant in order to know if anything was left you had to pick it up and shake it. These were the kinds that we impossible to clean as well.<br /><br />We highly recommend this product. So does Roxxee, our dog, who still finds eating to be a fun activity.",Positive,bought month old lab keep inhaling dinner second flat purchased gift dog ownersit took dog day half figure toy first barked since frustrated could see smell kibble couldnt get happy mistake pawing watching u pull rope caught take minute eat cup kibble insidegreat feature durable easy wash nalgene type material rope actually flexible rubber stick making washingsanitizing easy screwoff bottom make loading toy simple translucent bottle see much kibble left hold sort size kibblechallenging feature sometimes take try get bottom screwed back bc thread narrow bottom never fallen dog cant figure unscrew bottomwe tried treat ball past found couldnt hold enough kibble keep activity going long treat ball product either big small dog kibble making getting food either way easy fell right hard took human thumb get finally treat ball solid rubber meant order know anything left pick shake kind impossible clean wellwe highly recommend product roxxee dog still find eating fun activity

1,Stopped working after just 3 months.,"Update - Feb 27, 2012<br />The product worked fine for about 6 weeks.  In the last two weeks we have had issues where the device wouldn't steam intermittently.  Everything was done exactly the same way.  No user error.  Then finally last week it seems the bearings (I think they have bearing) in the center colum broke.  The underside of the Baby brezza is dark - presumably from the grease in the bearings.  The device would steam, but the blade would not spin.<br />Then today, it stopped steaming as well.  About to send the product back.  Had nothing but problems with this since we got it.  $100 just wasted.  Wouldn't recommend it.  Extrememly frustrating when at the last minute you have to figure out some other way to feed your kid.  Products like this need to work, and work well.  They are after all for children and will be used everyday!  Not sure what kind of quality control this company has.<br /><br />(update after a couple of weeks of use)<br />The product does work well.  Yes there are some lumps but if you manually hit the blend button for a bit longer you can get a very smooth puree for your child.<br />The one other issue I have found is that the blade is a bit difficult to take off.  I have to pull it quite hard 40% of the time - hard enought that I though I was going to break the plastic.  My wife felt the same way.  So my rating of 3 stars don't change, however it is stable and good product and we do use it daily.<br /><br />Overall the product works.  However I did have one major problem.  The first time I tried to use the product, it would steam, and the motor would turn on but the blade wouldn't spin.  I called up Baby Brezza and it turns out they had a manufacturing issue where the belt had slipped off the cog for the blade.  They knew about the issue and immediately told me to remove the 5 screws from the bottom, remove the cover and slip the belt onto the cog.  All in all, it was easy to do and took all but 5 minutes.  However, the fact that you get a product that would not work right out the box was a huge dissapointment and my wife was really frustrated.<br />On the plus side, the lady at Baby Brezza did know the issue and was able to get me going right away.  First time I have had success with customer service with any company.",Negative,update feb product worked fine week last two week issue device wouldnt steam intermittently everything done exactly way user error finally last week seems bearing think bearing center colum broke underside baby brezza dark presumably grease bearing device would steam blade would spinthen today stopped steaming well send product back nothing problem since got wasted wouldnt recommend extrememly frustrating last minute figure way feed kid product like need work work well child used everyday sure kind quality control company hasupdate couple week usethe product work well yes lump manually hit blend button bit longer get smooth puree childthe one issue found blade bit difficult take pull quite hard time hard enought though going break plastic wife felt way rating star dont change however stable good product use dailyoverall product work however one major problem first time tried use product would steam motor would turn blade wouldnt spin called baby brezza turn manufacturing issue belt slipped cog blade knew issue immediately told remove screw bottom remove cover slip belt onto cog easy took minute however fact get product would work right box huge dissapointment wife really frustratedon plus side lady baby brezza know issue able get going right away first time success customer service company

5,Wow!,"I just had this soup as a quick lunch and it was incredible! I was actually quite surprised - not by the excellent quality, but by the bold and intense flavors. It is spicy, creamy, and savory. And it is an excellent source of nutrition. The caloric and fat content is a good healthy type of fat coming from coconut milk, which has many health benefits. If you don't like sweet potatoes, spicy red chile's, creamy coconut milk, and a hint of lime - this soup is not for you and I would suggest sticking to the more fake quality other brands tend to offer (with 5 times the sodium and less flavor).",Positive,soup quick lunch incredible actually quite surprised excellent quality bold intense flavor spicy creamy savory excellent source nutrition caloric fat content good healthy type fat coming coconut milk many health benefit dont like sweet potato spicy red chile creamy coconut milk hint lime soup would suggest sticking fake quality brand tend offer time sodium less flavor

It is like dog heroin for my dogs, there is nothing they won't do for these treats.  It makes training a breeze.  My current dog, Samson, will sit in front of the pantry and drool until I give him a treat.  The treats are expensive so I cut them in quarters so they last longer.  These are 100% meat, no scrap or filler.  These are the only treats I give Samson, my Rottweiler.

4,Caviar for less money,"I developed a real craving for some caviar a few weeks ago, after not having had any for a couple of years. I searched though Google, eBay, and Amazon till I found this product. It actually reminded me of a similar brand I used to buy in a Gourmet Giant Supermarket. While searching I was reminded that caviar ranges dramatically in price from thousands of dollars to less than ten for a few ounces. A friend recently told me about a cruise ship locker that held over a million dollars worth on every cruise! The best caviar I ever tasted was at a 5* Marriot hotel in downtown Copenhagen. I ordered their caviar salad appetizer every day during a week long business trip. So with that background in mind for me this product was well worth the $30 some odd dollars I spent with shipping to receive 4 3.5 ounce containers. I even purchased some fancy crackers, and real cr&egrave;me fresh to go with it. I prefer small black caviar to other varieties, and while this purchase wasn't the tastiest I have ever had, it satisfied my craving and more. By wife also enjoyed this treat and complained when I emptied one of the containers before she had her ""fair share."" I would buy this product from this vendor again, but I also plan to compare it with what others have to offer. I would be curious to hear what others have to say about where to get low cost high quality black caviar.

4,My Dog gave it 2 paws up :),"My Large Shepard/Chow/Collie Mix is very smart and easily bored. Lets just say he can disembowel a stuffed toy in seconds. Anywhoo, we needed to find a toy that at least challenges him a little bit. The Paw puzzle was fun for him and my family to use. He's definitely food motivated so this was a perfect fit. At first he was laying down while trying to lift up the cups and he couldn't get them up. So i was a little worried they might be a little to smooth for him to lift up but then he stood and gripped the cup in his teeth and pulled it up. He now has the hang of it and can find all the treats in no time. Its great for training (you add the command find it to your routine and it can become a whole new trick/job for your dog). The only down side I can think of is that it's a bit bulky for a toy (you can't just throw it in a dog toy bin) and that it might get old fast for some dogs or owners to use. My other dog is a Amstaff mix and she showed interest in the treats but no desire to search for them lol. So certain breeds may not think this is the bee's knee's. Its easily cleaned, a nice grade of plastic ( although i worry about the cups cracking). You definitely want to supervise while your dog is having fun with this toy. Other than that its fun, and well worth it.",Positive,large shepardchowcollie mix smart easily bored let say disembowel stuffed toy second anywhoo needed find toy least challenge little bit paw puzzle fun family use he definitely food motivated perfect fit first laying trying lift cup couldnt get little worried might little smooth lift stood gripped cup teeth pulled hang find treat time great training add command find routine become whole new trickjob dog side think bit bulky toy cant throw dog toy bin might get old fast dog owner use dog amstaff mix showed interest treat desire search lol certain breed may think bee knee easily cleaned nice grade plastic although worry cup cracking definitely want supervise dog fun toy fun well worth
5,Yum...SO Good!,"[...] I took it out of the box rinsed the package kneaded as directed and ate it straight out of the package.  It was so good I will definitely continue to order and probably try the other flavors as well.  Almond butter is a much healthier than Peanut Butter especially this brand and another brand I ate which only contain a few ingredients.  FYI for those who like Peanut Butter Justin's brands are just as healthy as their Almond Butters.  I wanted to try the squeeze packs because the other brand I have eaten in the past though good, it's such a pain to have to stir this huge jar of it every time and I like to keep an eye on my calories so having to measure out a serving from a jar each time gets messy plus it's so bland I always add a little honey to it.  This was was perfect not bland like plain Almond Butter, but not too sweet or salty just enough of everything.  Besides the convenience of not having to stir and measure from a jar I like knowing exactly how much I am getting plus these can be thrown in my purse when I go out for a quick healthy snack when I am out.  Being Gluten, Corn, Soy & Diary Free (among a few other things) makes its difficult when out so it's nice to be able to have something with me that I know is healthy and I am allowed to have.",Positive,took box rinsed package kneaded directed ate straight package good definitely continue order probably try flavor well almond butter much healthier peanut butter especially brand another brand ate contain ingredient fyi like peanut butter justins brand healthy almond butter wanted try squeeze pack brand eaten past though good pain stir huge jar every time like keep eye calorie measure serving jar time get messy plus bland always add little honey perfect bland like plain almond butter sweet salty enough everything besides convenience stir measure jar like knowing exactly much getting plus thrown purse go quick healthy snack gluten corn soy diary free among thing make difficult nice able something know healthy allowed

Until finding it on Amazon, I had never heard of this brand before.  After reading some of the reviews, I was hesitant, but I love pumpkin, so I placed my order.<br /><br />The items came in less than a week (I ordered right before the Memorial Day holiday weekend).  Every can but one (which had the slightest dent) was in excellent condition.  The cans were packed in a cardboard tray, shrink wrapped and then bubble wrapped before being boxed for shipping.<br /><br />The taste is just right to me -- pumpkin, not too light or too strong.  The consistency is not too thin or too thick, but again, just right. The quality is comparable to (if not better than) its brand name competitor.  The product is organic pumpkin, period.<br /><br />My compliments and gratitude to Farmer's Market Foods.

Both my wife and I drink our coffee with cream though, so maybe if you were just to drink it black you'd experience something different?

I understand that this is organic, but I received this in June and it expired this month. I also understand that it is a problem with Amazon, but since this is an Amazon review, I'm bringing it up.<br /><br />I did try it, and I have to say after trying the food, I was super disappointed that my baby wasn't going to be able to because I thought it was pretty good myself. I was honestly surprised that it wasn't bitter or gross. I loved the packing of this product but wonder if we aren't paying more because of it. The price to me seems a bit on the high side.

And they were delivered by Amazon, right to our house, so that made it really easy. Especially since you can't find that much interesting to choose from at the store. I wouldn't say I disliked any of them. Some I loved or liked better than others but they were all pretty good and it was fun to have the choice options.

5,Excellent.,"This is some of the best coffee of any kind that I've had in years. I don't write a lot of reviews, but had to give these folks credit for an excellent product. I like very strong coffee and San Francisco Bay French Roast delivers - rich flavor, delightful aroma... yes, due to the unique pod design (which works perfectly with my Keurig brewer) you have to store them in an airtight manner, but it's totally worth it. The only improvement I'd suggest is making their shipping bags - which have a valve like on a regular bag of coffee - zip-top, so I can use them without a rubber band after opening. But I expect that my have price implications, and I prefer the lower price over a better bag.",Positive,best coffee kind ive year dont write lot review give folk credit excellent product like strong coffee san francisco bay french roast delivers rich flavor delightful aroma yes due unique pod design work perfectly keurig brewer store airtight manner totally worth improvement id suggest making shipping bag valve like regular bag coffee ziptop use without rubber band opening expect price implication prefer lower price better bag

4,"Mild taste, easy to mix, will buy again","I held off ordering these for a while because I was concerned I might not like the taste. I've tried some of the organic green teas and found flavor can really vary between brands. Six boxes seems like a lot to take a chance on. I really wanted something powdered to take to work though, so I gave it chance and it worked out.  To me, this product tastes great.  I am thrilled to get something unsweetened.  I wanted these to use at the office, but find I like them so much I mix them up at home too. I just wish they were a little cheaper as they go really fast.  I went from thinking 6 boxes would be a lot, to experiencing them as hardly enouugh!<br /><br />Basically, this product has a mild taste, never bitter or oily and not gritty (but it will need to be remixed if you don't drink it down quickly).  The powder does mix well, it's really a very fine powder and does not look like leaves just mashed up or anything.  It blends completely into the water, BUT it doesn't stay mixed over a long period of time.  So, if you are letting it sit in the glass about 20min or so as you sip away, it's useful to get one of those shaker bottles to keep it mixed as you go along.  That works for me, no complaints.  I am very happy with the product.  I will order again.",Positive,held ordering concerned might like taste ive tried organic green tea found flavor really vary brand six box seems like lot take chance really wanted something powdered take work though gave chance worked product taste great thrilled get something unsweetened wanted use office find like much mix home wish little cheaper go really fast went thinking box would lot experiencing hardly enouughbasically product mild taste never bitter oily gritty need remixed dont drink quickly powder mix well really fine powder look like leaf mashed anything blend completely water doesnt stay mixed long period time letting sit glass min sip away useful get one shaker bottle keep mixed go along work complaint happy product order

5,Nice rice!,"Once upon a time, I used cheap rice for dishes.  Over time, I have discovered that there are preferable products.  This Jasmati long grain American jasmine rice exemplifies. It is one of a series of rices produced  by Rice Select.<br /><br />It has a nice texture and a nice taste once you prepare it.  When I make my recipe for fried rice from my copy of ""Joy of Cooking,"" this is my most often used selection of rice.  The end result is tasty!  As I pour my stir fry over the fried rice, a delicious meal (well, normally) results. But a good rice base is necessary for a successful stir fry.  That combination of vegetables, sauce, some sort of meat (normally chicken), and fried rice does the trick!<br /><br />I also use this rice when I use my slow cooker.  It is useful to have some sort of base to absorb the excess liquid from the slow cooking process.  Rice does the job very well--and this is one of the rices that I depend on when doling out the crock pot dish into the serving dish for my family.  Yummy!<br /><br />All in all, then, this is a useful product for those who enjoy using rice in their cooking adventures!",Positive,upon time used cheap rice dish time discovered preferable product jasmati long grain american jasmine rice exemplifies one series rice produced rice selectit nice texture nice taste prepare make recipe fried rice copy joy cooking often used selection rice end result tasty pour stir fry fried rice delicious meal well normally result good rice base necessary successful stir fry combination vegetable sauce sort meat normally chicken fried rice tricki also use rice use slow cooker useful sort base absorb excess liquid slow cooking process rice job welland one rice depend doling crock pot dish serving dish family yummyall useful product enjoy using rice cooking adventure

4,Good tasting tea.,"This tea tastes pretty good. As a tea lover I think it could be a little stronger, as it doesn't have a very strong flavor (though I do use my cups twice to fill a small pitcher). It is sweetened with sugar (18g per k-cup, I think) and stevia. I'm not a big fan of artificial sweeteners but I'd much rather it be stevia than another toxic chemical sweetener. There is no foreign after taste, which makes it more agreeable. If you like sweet iced tea and you are willing to use stevia, I recommend this product.",Positive,tea taste pretty good tea lover think could little stronger doesnt strong flavor though use cup twice fill small pitcher sweetened sugar g per kcup think stevia im big fan artificial sweetener id much rather stevia another toxic chemical sweetener foreign taste make agreeable like sweet iced tea willing use stevia recommend product

1,FLAVORED COFFEE??,Nowhere in the description does it mention anything about this coffee being flavored. I'm still not sure what flavor it is. Some type of nut. I wrongly assumed that Jamaican coffee would be similar to the Blue Mountain coffee which Jamaica is known for! How silly of me to assume that! I hate flavored coffees so I was so disappointed to now own 2 boxes of such a horrible coffee. It only says flavored very small on the box so I didn't notice it before I opened it.

However, NO ONE IN MY FAMILY would eat them when I put them out, and said they tasted like cardboard.  I have a full case now, which will be ""my crackers only"" for probably the next two years--unless I find another ""health"" nut that will join me in eating them!

I was trying to decide between the little boxes and these and chose the cup over the box because of the convenience of just adding milk to the cup.  Though the idea was still cute, each cup had very smudged artwork and the cups all had black ash on the outside of them while sealed in the General Mills box.  It was so bad, I almost thought they might be counterfeit.  The cereal seemed to taste the way it should, but since I bought these for their branding and aesthetics too, I was disappointed.

It has the same taste and texture of any full or multi-grain organic pasta, but with only 16g of carbs compared to DeBoles with 46g/serving. That was a no-brainer for me. I'm not a huge pasta fan, but at least if I am going to have spaghetti this makes much more sense than regular pasta. :)",Positive,looking way add bean specifically protein less carbs diet found pasta love taste texture full multigrain organic pasta g carbs compared deboles gserving nobrainer im huge pasta fan least going spaghetti make much sense regular pasta

5,Micro pork rinds freshest you can buy.,"When I saw the price of the pork rinds plus free shipping, and since I had never tried the micro rinds before I decided I would give it a try. I ordered a box of the Spicy and one of the Original.<br />They were here in no time.<br />We have a 1000 watt micro and we experimented a couple of times and found that 92 seconds was perfect for us. If we have a few that do not puff up (which rarely happens) you can put the few on a paper plate and put them back in the micro and it takes just a few seconds for them to puff up.<br />Because I am not a spicy food lover I wasn't as crazy about the Spicy as the Original but my husband loved them. So that made it possible for each of us to have a box of our own. Wahoo, I didn't have to share with him. Worked out great.<br />I would liked to have had a little less salt on them but was able to knock some off just by tapping the rind on the plate as I ate them.<br /><br />I would give this an excellent rating, in fact I am going to order 2 more boxes after I finish this.",Positive,saw price pork rind plus free shipping since never tried micro rind decided would give try ordered box spicy one originalthey timewe watt micro experimented couple time found second perfect u puff rarely happens put paper plate put back micro take second puff upbecause spicy food lover wasnt crazy spicy original husband loved made possible u box wahoo didnt share worked greati would liked little less salt able knock tapping rind plate ate themi would give excellent rating fact going order box finish

5,Ingredients,"After reading the review about the change of ingredients, I contacted Holistic Select to double check the information and they clearly state that there are no pork products in this food.

5,Very good nonfat dry milk,"Has a better, creamier flavor than the Safeway Lucerne and Albertsons store brands.<br /><br />The Saco doesn't dissolve quite as quickly as those two, but it does fully dissolve if you wait a few minutes or make it ahead of time and let it sit in the fridge overnight as the instructions suggest. One reviewer said it wouldn't dissolve ""even in boiling water"", but boiling water cooks the proteins and makes them lumpy, same as if you boil regular milk, and once that's happened, it'll never dissolve.<br /><br />With Super Saver free shipping, the Amazon price is currently only a little less than Safeway, but the milk is slighly better, and I can get a larger quantity from Amazon than the few little boxes the local Safeway keeps stocked on its powdered milk shelf at any one time.<br /><br />The box in which Amazon shipped my 2-box order would, I think, have held exactly 3 of the Saco boxes.",Positive,better creamier flavor safeway lucerne albertsons store brandsthe saco doesnt dissolve quite quickly two fully dissolve wait minute make ahead time let sit fridge overnight instruction suggest one reviewer said wouldnt dissolve even boiling water boiling water cook protein make lumpy boil regular milk thats happened itll never dissolvewith super saver free shipping amazon price currently little less safeway milk slighly better get larger quantity amazon little box local safeway keep stocked powdered milk shelf one timethe box amazon shipped box order would think held exactly saco box

3,"Very blackberry, no vanilla","I always enjoy how a flavored coffee or tea smells.  I've usually found that the taste is never as good as the smell.  In the case of Lipton Blackberry Vanilla Herbal Pyramid Tea Bags, this has been my experience.  The bag is an eye-catching design that entices because of the texture of the tea and infusions.  The smell is amazing!  I would make this into an air freshener in a heartbeat!  The flavor wasn't bad, but it was overpoweringly blackberry.

5,"Tasty, filling, healthy!","I don't like starchy, salty, and thick soups (too much starch actually makes me hungry). This particular variety (roasted chicken and vegetable) fits the bill. It is sparse on the noodle, with only 4 g of sugar per can (I have never eaten half a can of soup, so, all values are for the entire can). While still high, the sodium for the can is 920 mg: much less then in a ""regular"" soup.  The satisfying taste belies the 140 calories and only 2 g of fat! The liquid is light, but there is lots to chew on in the bowl: many chunks of meat and firm veggies make this a meal, rather then a snack. The ring on top of the can makes it easy to open. You can tuck a can in your purse and take it along to the office for a quick lunch. So far, so good.<br /><br />The only downside is the price. Even though I ordered the soup thru the Subscribe and Save programme, I paid for the dozen more then $6 over the price in the local mass retailer. It is not worth it, even with the covenience of free shipping. I will continue to buy the soup, just not on-line. Make sure to do your price research, but eaither way do give this variety a try.

3,Good for One Use,"I like to brew myself a single cup of coffee every once in a while. I have the Melitta filters and a plastic cone holder. I place both on top of a coffee cup and pour in the hot water. This method works well once. If you plan to have a second cup of coffee, add a touch more coffee grounds, and run through another round of water, it will not work well. The flow is blocked and slow. Even if you move around the grounds with a spoon, the drip is too slow to warrant a second use.<br /><br />So these are good once. If you want to save on waste and cut down on your garbage creation, pick another method.<br /><br />I visited their website and couldn't find any information on their annual donations to forest conservation.

4,Caution - may cause kitty stampede,"I called upon a panel of two expert feline food testers assist me with this review.  The first, Apollo, is quite enthusiastic about food related assignments and is usually most concerned about quantity.  The second, LJ, is more discerning about food, occasionally refusing to participate.<br /><br />When I opened the first selection, Chicken Pot Pie I noticed a quantity of liquid around the solid portion of the meal and was concerned that it was perhaps spoiled.  I detected no bad odor so I offered it to my panel, who were incidentally becoming quite impatient.  Apollo immediately began to consume his portion, pausing only when the dish was empty.  LJ took her usual cautious sniff of the food and then began to eagerly lap up the liquid, pausing to take a bite of the solids from time to time.  She too did not stop eating until the entire portion was consumed.<br /><br />At the next testing session I offered the Chinese Chicken selection.  This one looked much more like other canned cat food but had a more pronounced odor.  Both testers arrived at their stations without being summoned.  Again both testers were enthusiastic about their assignments and did not stop until the entire portion was consumed.  In fact when the testers were disturbed by two members of the canine food testing team they expressed great displeasure.<br /><br />As I was preparing the food samples a member of the human food testing panel remarked that the feline samples, particularly the Chinese Chicken, looked better than much of the food she had been eating at college.<br /><br />Obviously the feline panel was quite taken with the product.  Our chief accountant had some issues with it however since this product costs about four times as much per ounce as our usual offering. (Note:  usual offering has kept six cats quite healthy for more than thirty years).  With this price factor in mind I divided each single serving (3 oz) can between the two testers and supplemented with dry food.<br /><br />Due to the enthusiastic endorsements by the feline food testers and based on my prior experience with aging felines' diminished appetites, I will purchase this product in the future as a supplement to the usual feline menu offerings, much as the human menu is supplemented by holiday meals or upscale restaurant outings.",Positive,called upon panel two expert feline food tester assist review first apollo quite enthusiastic food related assignment usually concerned quantity second lj discerning food occasionally refusing participatewhen opened first selection chicken pot pie noticed quantity liquid around solid portion meal concerned perhaps spoiled detected bad odor offered panel incidentally becoming quite impatient apollo immediately began consume portion pausing dish empty lj took usual cautious sniff food began eagerly lap liquid pausing take bite solid time time stop eating entire portion consumedat next testing session offered chinese chicken selection one looked much like canned cat food pronounced odor tester arrived station without summoned tester enthusiastic assignment stop entire portion consumed fact tester disturbed two member canine food testing team expressed great displeasureas preparing food sample member human food testing panel remarked feline sample particularly chinese chicken looked better much food eating collegeobviously feline panel quite taken product chief accountant issue however since product cost four time much per ounce usual offering note usual offering kept six cat quite healthy thirty year price factor mind divided single serving oz two tester supplemented dry fooddue enthusiastic endorsement feline food tester based prior experience aging feline diminished appetite purchase product future supplement usual feline menu offering much human menu supplemented holiday meal upscale restaurant outing

This year, they were bought by ConAgra, the plant was closed and production was moved to Ohio.  That's not all that was changed.  The cans used to be brimming with beans with just enough sauce.  Now fully a third of each can is sauce...they're selling us WATER.  They taste the same and for that I'm grateful, but the can says ""Beans"" and I expect beans...not water.  Some slick suit has decided to maximize profit by compromising the brand.  Won't work here and I've bought my last can until I can shake the can and it sounds like it has more beans than water.

Even when you add all that water to the mix, I hope you're on a starvation diet, because the serving size on the box is 2 tablespoons!!!! TWO TABLESPOONS! What are you supposed to do with 4 cups of chicken soup (with a stray micro-noodle floating by now and then) when your alloted portion is two tablespoons?

1,Way overpriced; only average taste,"Always on the lookout for a new coffee adventure, I took the plunge with this very expensive grind (almost $2/oz!), based upon all the glowing reviews here. The verdict: Huh? What kind of crummy coffee are the ***** rating reviewers comparing this to that it supposedly tastes so ""out of this world""? After the first cup (brewed using my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G71J6G"">Swissgold KF 300 One-Cup Coffee Filter</a> in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000REZVW6"">Trudeau Board Room Desk Mug, Brown Leatherette</a>, using the recipe I've used for every other cup I've ever brewed, I thought: ""Jeez, this stuff tastes kinda flat and a bit burned!"" I backed off the amount I used in my next cup, which slightly improved the taste, but then it seemed like it was a bit weak, and therefore intolerable. About the only thing going for it is that it is not bitter tasting.<br /><br />The container in which the coffee comes is neat, though -- a plastic-lined, screw-on lid topping a stylish can -- and I'll get some good use out of it for storing other items once I've finished with this stuff. But I'm here to tell ya that this coffee is most definitely not worth the lofty price.<br /><br />One more problem: This stuff is ground to a near-powder consistency. It tends to clog any drip filter as when wet it becomes like a lump of tar.<br /><br />My recommendation for a truly great, flavorful cup o' java: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007G96XO"">100% Colombia Supremo</a>.

5,A great soda alternative...,"Being half-Cuban, I had heard of Iron Beer before, but I had never actually had a chance to try it. Unlike Materva, which is relatively easy to get (even in South Carolina), I've never so much as seen Iron Beer on a shelf here. I went ahead and took the plunge, ordering it online, and was ever-so-pleasantly surprised. It definitely reminds me of a mix of cream soda and orange soda (another reviewer said it tasted like orange dreamsicle, which is pretty dead-on actually), but somehow it manages to be a lot more than the sum of its parts...maybe it's that ""hint of island spices."" Highly recommended for those who want something new, or those who simply want a taste of home.",Positive,halfcuban heard iron beer never actually chance try unlike materva relatively easy get even south carolina ive never much seen iron beer shelf went ahead took plunge ordering online eversopleasantly surprised definitely reminds mix cream soda orange soda another reviewer said tasted like orange dreamsicle pretty deadon actually somehow manages lot sum partsmaybe hint island spice highly recommended want something new simply want taste home
4,Individually boxed and very fresh.,"I had been craving fruitcake during the holidays but couldn't find the time to go get one locally so I purchased these last week to share with family and friends.<br /><br />They arrived well packaged in a large box, then inside was a smaller box with 10 individually boxed fruit cakes. They are the same fruitcakes you purchase at stores except each one comes in an indvidual cardboard box. This is great if you plan to gift these because it makes a more presentable package and will probably keep them fresher. I was impressed that each one had its own box.<br /><br />These also arrived very soft and fresh like they had been shipped soon after they were made and not sitting around in a warehouse all year. These are the freshest I've had including when I purchased them at local stores.<br /><br />They sell these locally for $3.99 each plus tax. However, the price on Amazon is cheaper than I bought them on the Claxton website and I prefer to buy from Amazon. I will purchase these again next year and would recommend them.",Positive,craving fruitcake holiday couldnt find time go get one locally purchased last week share family friendsthey arrived well packaged large box inside smaller box individually boxed fruit cake fruitcake purchase store except one come indvidual cardboard box great plan gift make presentable package probably keep fresher impressed one boxthese also arrived soft fresh like shipped soon made sitting around warehouse year freshest ive including purchased local storesthey sell locally plus tax however price amazon cheaper bought claxton website prefer buy amazon purchase next year would recommend

5,Awsome Peanutbutter ...,"First of all, I do buy this at my local supermarket because it is a little cheaper (even with tax). I wanted to see if it was less on Amazon. So here is a review.<br /><br />I get this because it has no added salt. And while I am not on a low salt diet, most doctors say we (Americans) take in too much. This is great tasting and not crazy expensive. AND ... their website offers two tips. First, while natural, it does NOT need to be refrigerated. However, that will keep the oil from separating. And THE MOST IMPORTANT is ... if you turn the jar upside down when you get it home, in an hour most of the oil will re-absorb back into the butter. This makes it very easy to mix the first time. After the initial mix, you can refrigerate and no more mixing will be needed.<br /><br />Normally I get two jars at a time. By flipping both upside down, after a day or so, both jars require almost no mixing because the oil has been totally re-absorb back into the butter.<br /><br />Their website says that you can take off a spoon full of oil, which makes mixing easier. If you do the flipping trick, I find that is unnecessary.<br /><br />Anyway, while I did not find this cheaper here on Amazon, I'm still glad I got to tell you how much I love this stuff!",Positive,first buy local supermarket little cheaper even tax wanted see less amazon reviewi get added salt low salt diet doctor say american take much great tasting crazy expensive website offer two tip first natural need refrigerated however keep oil separating important turn jar upside get home hour oil reabsorb back butter make easy mix first time initial mix refrigerate mixing needednormally get two jar time flipping upside day jar require almost mixing oil totally reabsorb back buttertheir website say take spoon full oil make mixing easier flipping trick find unnecessaryanyway find cheaper amazon im still glad got tell much love stuff

2,Bad for teeth,"Wellness is the brand I go to for dry and wet food for my dog, so I thought I'd try the chicken and cheddar bars.  The second ingredient is cane molasses... I honestly don't know why this is, and it seems odd.  As soon as you open the bag inside the box, you get a whiff of an overwhelming sweetness.  After my dog has one, he's constantly trying to get the caked treat off of his back molars.  It sticks on pretty hard.  I have to help or I have to brush his teeth to get rid of it.  This can't be good for his teeth, and I don't know if he needs the extra sweetness in his diet.  I would recommend Old Mother Hubbard wheat-free treats, such as chicken and apples, before this.

4,"Mild coffee, great aroma with no sour taste at all.","This gourmet coffee has a delicious aroma, but a very mild taste. Which is good for drinking while  having breakfast, but not to drink alone or with milk, if one likes strong coffee.  The little pods are convenient for taking along while traveling. They work well on those small coffeemakers provided in hotels. One thing I didn't noticed the first time I had one, and which makes a different when brewing the coffee pods, it's that each one says, This Side Down, and of course, placing it in that position inside the pod brewer helps improve the result. The lack of bitterness is a definitely a plus.",Positive,gourmet coffee delicious aroma mild taste good drinking breakfast drink alone milk one like strong coffee little pod convenient taking along traveling work well small coffeemakers provided hotel one thing didnt noticed first time one make different brewing coffee pod one say side course placing position inside pod brewer help improve result lack bitterness definitely plus

It's very tasty, and to me it taste just like milk.<br /><br />With Amazon's ""subscribe and save"" I end-up saving a penny over buying the 64oz organic Rice dream container from my local grocer.  However with Amazon, I get better customer service and don't have to deal with the grumpy and at times unfriendly folks at the grocer. Being priced at $2.14 a quart, organic rice dream is also cheaper than organic milk which is about $3.59 a quart (32 oz) at Walmart.<br /><br />This particular rice dream is organic and for those who are concerned, it is also gluten free.<br /><br />UPDATE: Amazon sells this for exactly 8.45 cents per ounce. Walmart sells the 64oz for $3.24 = 5.06 cents per ounce.

5,Energy!,"I read a lot of positive reviews about Cytomax being the better version of Gatorade so I decided to try.<br /><br />Boy boy boy, it was GOOD. I use it during workout to keep my stamina up. I feel the difference on the days I do not use it. I could not sustain myself as long as I wanted. By the way, I do Insanity Workout. So that's insanely difficult. With Cytomax, I can definitely keep up with the workout better. Without it, I find myself panting for breath.<br /><br />The good thing about Cytomax is that it is highly refined. When you pour the powder down into your bottle, you can see white powders in the air and you see fizzing in the water immediately. It is so refined. That means it mixes quickly. The only thing that annoys me is that even though it mixes well in general, sometimes you get clumping of it stuck at the bottom of the bottle. That's the only bad thing about Cytomax.<br /><br />The taste is brilliant. I have tried the grape, citrus, and pomegranate with grape being the tastiest one. Eventually, after using Cytomax, I do not want to use any other product. The dosage of Cytomax also decreases as I become stronger and could sustain myself longer without additional aid.<br /><br />Give it a try. You won't regret it. The electrolytes help me to not get cramping because high intensity cardio movements usually wear me down quickly and without replenishing all the sodium, my muscle will get really tired and tense.

5,"Tastes great, perfect alternative.","I haven't had soda or carbonation in years. I got this for my parents who, to avoid sugar, drink nothing but aspartame filled fresca black cherry and peach. Figuring that is so much worse, I was so excited to find Zevia and currently am awaiting my parents to try the flavors. I myself grabbed a Dr. Zevia because I loved Dr. Pepper back when I used to drink soda. Now it has been years, so I cracked it open and noted a considerable spice and cherry smell. I took a sip and felt a punch to the throat like I downed some great tasting apple cider vinegar. That's not a problem with this product, it's just what happens when you haven't had carbonated drinks in years. It tastes just like Dr. Pepper, maybe a little bit like a diet but that's not a problem because it tastes great all the same AND you're not compromising your health.

No difficulty for him, at all.<br /><br />Lamb treats are usually foul in smell and they're just as worse on the way out, too.

3,two small issues,"I have no idea why I ordered these... must have been pretty hungry that day and just needed something to fill the order to get my free shipping.<br /><br />But speaking of shipping, I ordered these ""MINI WHITE ROUNDS"" and an equivalent order of ""TATO SKINS"".  The ""skins"" arrived unbroken while the ""rounds"" were about half rounds and half crumbles.  I think the difference was that the ""skins"" people engineered the size of the box just right so the puffy bags held each other in place, while the ""rounds"" people just threw a dozen bags into the box and only filled it about 3/4 of the way, leaving the bags free to slop around inside.<br /><br />Secondly, just the cursory test, I opened a bag and tasted a few, sort of expecting a ""tostitos"" or ""mission"" kind of taste, but they were just a kind of bland corn tortilla taste... which is exactly what they were supposed to be, but ... well you know... expected a taste that would keep me reaching back into the bag until I was ashamed of myself... the ""Tato Skins"" certainly did!

5,Lives up to its name,"My grandpa used to tell stories about eating this stuff in his Army days.  They called it ""hardtack"" or just simply ""tack"".  It also seems to be a Swedish staple food.  I grew up in Texas so it is kind of hard to find around here, especially the hearty rye kind.  One time I went to purchase a few packages of it at the local ""gourmet food and liquor"" store and the cashier warned me someone had returned it because it was ""stale"".  I told her that they must have been clueless, cause that's how its SUPPOSED to taste.  The stopped carrying it soon after.  I'll just have to start special-ordering it.  It's cheaper here, anyway..<br /><br />I've tried many other Wasa crispbreads and I always come back to this one.  Nothing compares to the hearty rye.  It has a very thick, satisfying crunch and a nice, bland rye flavor.  I eat it with anything and everything, or even by itself.  It's great if you spread butter on it and eat it with soup.  Other examples: tuna fish, cheese, lunchmeat, peanut butter, ice cream, salsa verde, chocolate pudding, Wolf chili, banana slices, SPAM, etc.  Be creative.<br /><br />It NEVER GOES STALE, so don't worry too much about sealing up the package.  I believe that's a design principle in all hardtacks (see wikipedia).  In my opinion, it only gets better with age.  In reality, there is negligible difference between the freshly opened package and the months-old package.  Same crunch, same flavor.  It's like bread, but without the possibility of mold.  Oh, it's also healthy and stuff.  Lots of fiber.<br /><br />I highly recommend the hearty rye.  Buy a few cases now to prepare for Y2012 :)",Positive,grandpa used tell story eating stuff army day called hardtack simply tack also seems swedish staple food grew texas kind hard find around especially hearty rye kind one time went purchase package local gourmet food liquor store cashier warned someone returned stale told must clueless cause thats supposed taste stopped carrying soon ill start specialordering cheaper anywayive tried many wasa crispbreads always come back one nothing compare hearty rye thick satisfying crunch nice bland rye flavor eat anything everything even great spread butter eat soup example tuna fish cheese lunchmeat peanut butter ice cream salsa verde chocolate pudding wolf chili banana slice spam etc creativeit never go stale dont worry much sealing package believe thats design principle hardtack see wikipedia opinion get better age reality negligible difference freshly opened package monthsold package crunch flavor like bread without possibility mold oh also healthy stuff lot fiberi highly recommend hearty rye buy case prepare

5,You know it's Fall when Pumpkin Spice latte appears,"I cheer every year, even if it is still 102 degrees and I see that Starbucks is offering pumpkin spice latte.  The only thing I don't cheer about is the price for this addictive habit.  Now, I can make a pumpkin spice latte that ALMOST tastes like the ones a barrista makes and I don't have to leave a tip!  This flavored coffee has very good  flavors, especially of nutmeg but cinnamon and cloves are in there too.  Like all these coffees, using really hot water and stirring for at least a minute, makes a better cup and prevents the bottom of the cup residue.  This is a light coffee, not a strong robust one so don't think it is going to wake you up in the morning if you did something the night before you shouldn't have!  But it is very nice mid-day or evening treat and won't keep you awake unless you are sensitive to small amounts of caffeine.  You don't really want to serve it with dessert because it is too much like dessert itself but some vanilla flavored cookies go nicely with it.",Positive,cheer every year even still degree see starbucks offering pumpkin spice latte thing dont cheer price addictive habit make pumpkin spice latte almost taste like one barrista make dont leave tip flavored coffee good flavor especially nutmeg cinnamon clove like coffee using really hot water stirring least minute make better cup prevents bottom cup residue light coffee strong robust one dont think going wake morning something night shouldnt nice midday evening treat wont keep awake unless sensitive small amount caffeine dont really want serve dessert much like dessert vanilla flavored cooky go nicely

5,These things miraculous!,"This relatively simple innovation has absolutely saved the tender relationship I have with my cat.  As she was recently diagnosed asthmatic, I am now forced to administer up to 2 prednisone pills to my incredibly finicky, active and resistant 7yo Bombay mix.  Before I found these I was struggling with the ""pill popper""; even when that gadget successfully hit the target, I was forced to watch her foam vehemently at the mouth when the easily-dissolved and extremely bitter pill it launched hit any part of her tongue or back of her mouth, forcing her to choke - not to mention battling the scratches from the pour soul who thought her mom was poisoning her with this awful medicine.  Amazingly she liked both flavors of these pockets, and now gobbles them down - pills safely tucked inside - without so much as a shake of her head.  I'm forever grateful to Greenies for coming up with this great product - they have saved me years more of struggles with a cat forced to take daily pills!",Positive,relatively simple innovation absolutely saved tender relationship cat recently diagnosed asthmatic forced administer prednisone pill incredibly finicky active resistant yo bombay mix found struggling pill popper even gadget successfully hit target forced watch foam vehemently mouth easilydissolved extremely bitter pill launched hit part tongue back mouth forcing choke mention battling scratch pour soul thought mom poisoning awful medicine amazingly liked flavor pocket gobble pill safely tucked inside without much shake head im forever grateful greenies coming great product saved year struggle cat forced take daily pill
5,Excellent deal; very good tea,"I'm not a connoisseur of fine teas.  But, I do enjoy my tea, and gunpowder green has been a favorite of mine.  A big problem, though, is trying to find it.  There is a tea store near by that is very expensive.  If you buy 2 oz or more, it's $4.00 an oz.  Too expensive.  I finally found a couple of health food stores where it ranges in price from about 70 to 85 cents an oz, but it is such a hassle to drive there; and too many times they're out.  I've found it on-line, but the shipping costs haven't made it such a good deal.<br /><br />Well, with the ""subscription"" purchase, this is a great deal.  It's cheaper than anywhere I've found it, at $10.20 a pound or less than 64 cents an oz.  And I love that 48 hrs after placing the order, the post office delivered it to my house.<br /><br />So, the big test, then, is how is the tea?  Well, like I said, I'm not a connoisseur, but I do enjoy Davidson's Gunpowder Green.  It's as good as any that I've bought.  Since the stores where I have been buying it are anywhere from 10 to 25 miles away, and not even near anywhere I normally go, I can say that I have found my new source for tea.

4,Not your ordinary soft drink,"I have two complaints about most sodas: 1) too fizzy, and 2) too sweet. This sparkling apple juice is neither -- it's got a natural, delicious taste, with just the right amount of bubbles. So far I have only tried the apple juice, but based on this one, I am definitely planning to sample the others. I served it at a party and it proved to be a great alternative to beer or wine for those who didn't want to drink alcohol. My only complaint is that the can is kind of narrow and awkward -- I wish it came in bottles instead. I think the idea is to make it look more like an energy drink (it is fortified with some vitamins, but this is NOT an energy drink), but I find the bottles that other specialty sodas, like GuS or Jones, use to be easier to handle.",Positive,two complaint soda fizzy sweet sparkling apple juice neither got natural delicious taste right amount bubble far tried apple juice based one definitely planning sample others served party proved great alternative beer wine didnt want drink alcohol complaint kind narrow awkward wish came bottle instead think idea make look like energy drink fortified vitamin energy drink find bottle specialty soda like gu jones use easier handle
2,Another bad reaction. Why risk it?,"We adopted Penelope, a 6 mo. old min pin hound mix, a couple weeks ago. We decided to switch her from Purina Pro Plan w/ Shredded Chicken to a premium food. After reading many conflicting reviews on this site and elsewhere, we decided to try Canidae. My sister feeds Canidae with great results and, at our local pet store, it is the cheapest of the premium foods by a narrow margin.<br /><br />We mixed only a little Canidae into Penny's kibble. My guess is about 6-8 pieces or 1/12 of her total breakfast/dinner. We watched her very closely. Within a day, we noticed some changes. First of all, she lost a little focus in training, seeming a bit more confused than usual. No biggie. She also sneezed a few times (she has never sneezed before). More importantly, though, we noticed that she started to nibble and chew on her feet. This continued sporadically for another day and half. It wasn't constant or serious. She didn't seem agitated and she didn't bite her feet to the point of redness or bleeding. Still, it was VERY clear that this was caused by the change in diet (nothing else in her routine changed) and this was only with 12-16 pieces of Canidae per day. Having read the reviews of Canidae's new formula, we had known that this might happen. We made the decision to switch right away.<br /><br />After a lot of research, we decided to try Solid Gold Hund-N-Flocken for Puppies. We mixed in the Solid Gold at the same proportions as the Canidae. The nibbling stopped immediately. No sneezing, either. Her focus seems to have improved as well, though I can't completely credit that to the food because puppies have on and off days. Still, it is clear that the more serious allergy problems have been resolved.<br /><br />If you've done any research on dog foods at all, you already know that finding the right food requires you to go beyond the ingredient list. Some foods just don't work with some dogs, however good they look on paper. Indeed, I am convinced after many hours of reading reviews that NO food works for ALL dogs. That said, it is clear that many, many more people have had problems with the new Canidae formula than they have with other premium or super-premium brands. Who knows why (Canidae claims the new formula has no changes that could account for allergies), and who cares? Feel free to try Canidae for your dog, but watch him or her very closely. Or, better yet, do what I wish I did, and just start with a different brand. There is nothing special about the Canidae ingredients list, so why risk it?",Negative,adopted penelope mo old min pin hound mix couple week ago decided switch purina pro plan w shredded chicken premium food reading many conflicting review site elsewhere decided try canidae sister feed canidae great result local pet store cheapest premium food narrow marginwe mixed little canidae penny kibble guess piece total breakfastdinner watched closely within day noticed change first lost little focus training seeming bit confused usual biggie also sneezed time never sneezed importantly though noticed started nibble chew foot continued sporadically another day half wasnt constant serious didnt seem agitated didnt bite foot point redness bleeding still clear caused change diet nothing else routine changed piece canidae per day read review canidae new formula known might happen made decision switch right awayafter lot research decided try solid gold hundnflocken puppy mixed solid gold proportion canidae nibbling stopped immediately sneezing either focus seems improved well though cant completely credit food puppy day still clear serious allergy problem resolvedif youve done research dog food already know finding right food requires go beyond ingredient list food dont work dog however good look paper indeed convinced many hour reading review food work dog said clear many many people problem new canidae formula premium superpremium brand know canidae claim new formula change could account allergy care feel free try canidae dog watch closely better yet wish start different brand nothing special canidae ingredient list risk

3,"Great taste, very sweet, but hard to dissolve","This has a very nice taste. Fruity but with the tea behind it. Though it tastes a bit more like fruit flavored with tea then the reverse. I quite liked it. I drink a lot of these types of beverages so have tasted quite a few of them. I did find it hard to dissolve in cold water. If you have ice in it then it is even harder to dissolve so I recommend water first, add packet, dissolve, then add ice. I found that I only needed half the packet to get the flavor and taste I liked. This is unlike some other drinks where the whole packet in a bottle or container of water is required. It is very sweet and fairly strong. I did not find any bad or bitter taste as can sometimes happen with decaffienated beverages. If it dissolved better it would have had a higher rating.

5,"Romantic, Natural, Unique Tea Experience","*****<br />White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea is an exciting and unusual premium Numi tea. It is a white tea, more rare than other types of teas and less processed as well, having been only plucked and dried (not oxidized). Some people find white tea a subtler and more enjoyable type of tea experience (I know I do). White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea is certified organic, and is both fair trade and kosher.<br /><br />It is made from hand-wrapped white tea leaves and rosebuds! Rosebuds---can you imagine?!?! Those are the only two ingredients, and they are delicate and delicious, different from anything else I've ever tried. This Amazon page erroneously lists some other ingredients but these are absolutely NOT in this tea---it is made from only white tea and roses.<br /><br />This tea, like all Numi teas, is packaged with 100% post-consumer waste, and the tea bags are made from biodegradable filter paper. Numi does not believe in the practice of adding oils or flavorings to bolster flavors, and I love this and can tell the difference; for this and many other reasons, Numi is one of my favorite tea manufacturers.<br /><br />On the box, Numi writes: ""Roses have been a symbol of love and beauty since the dawn of romance. Numi's enchanting Velvet Garden(tm) releases a provocative sweet rosy taste as it blushes a soft pink. With every sip this liaison of organic rose petals and delicate Spring White tea imparts a silken smoothness. White Tea is the tender bud of the tea plant making it exquisitely subtle and supremely healthy. High in antioxidants and vitamin C, this uplifting Fair Trade Certified white tea blend will be the beginning of a long lasting love affair."" I have to agree. This is truly an amazing tea.<br /><br />If you like Numi teas, get it---you won't be sorry. If you are new to Numi but love white tea, or are curious to try it from the description, I do not think you could find a better source than Numi. If you are looking for a romantic tea, White Rose Velvet Garden White Tea fits the bill perfectly.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br />*****",Positive,white rose velvet garden white tea exciting unusual premium numi tea white tea rare type tea less processed well plucked dried oxidized people find white tea subtler enjoyable type tea experience know white rose velvet garden white tea certified organic fair trade kosherit made handwrapped white tea leaf rosebud rosebudscan imagine two ingredient delicate delicious different anything else ive ever tried amazon page erroneously list ingredient absolutely teait made white tea rosesthis tea like numi tea packaged postconsumer waste tea bag made biodegradable filter paper numi believe practice adding oil flavoring bolster flavor love tell difference many reason numi one favorite tea manufacturerson box numi writes rose symbol love beauty since dawn romance numis enchanting velvet gardentm release provocative sweet rosy taste blush soft pink every sip liaison organic rose petal delicate spring white tea imparts silken smoothness white tea tender bud tea plant making exquisitely subtle supremely healthy high antioxidant vitamin c uplifting fair trade certified white tea blend beginning long lasting love affair agree truly amazing teaif like numi tea get ityou wont sorry new numi love white tea curious try description think could find better source numi looking romantic tea white rose velvet garden white tea fit bill perfectlyhighly recommended

5,Consistently in the top ten recommended canned dog foods,"Had my big noble boy dog, who had been with me for ten years, die of Cancer recently. He was a animal shelter rescue (As all my pets have been, and are.), and a great creature who never wanted to ever show weakness.

4,"Delicious, but strange","These are quite different from the C Howard's violet mints I've eaten before, in many ways.  The taste was subtler and sweeter, and the candy itself was letter made, as to be expected from a product like this.  For those of you that don't know how these are made, they are Anise seeds(delicious seeds, somewhat similar to fennel) rolled in sugar and violet extract to create a pearl-like ball of sugar with anise flavor at its center.  Takes some getting used to, having an actual seed in the middle of a candy.  The main complaint I have with these is the aftertaste - the C Howards violet mints may have tasted slightly soapy and perfumey, but they leave you with a wonderful aftertaste that sweetens the breath for a while after.  These left me with the slightly unpleasant feeling that I had just eaten a flower, stem and all.  Still, they have a delicious, very purple taste.  Also, shipping was excellent, they came 2 days before the stated arrival time and were packaged well.  The tin they come in is also quite nice.",Positive,quite different c howard violet mint ive eaten many way taste subtler sweeter candy letter made expected product like dont know made anise seedsdelicious seed somewhat similar fennel rolled sugar violet extract create pearllike ball sugar anise flavor center take getting used actual seed middle candy main complaint aftertaste c howard violet mint may tasted slightly soapy perfumey leave wonderful aftertaste sweetens breath left slightly unpleasant feeling eaten flower stem still delicious purple taste also shipping excellent came day stated arrival time packaged well tin come also quite nice

WTF I thought and sure enough, it has oat bran in it.  My stupid dumb ***, I trust Newman's to have a product accurately reflecting the products on the label.  Brown rice and chicken aren't oats.  I guess my lesson learned is trust no one and read all the labels (actually did before i bought, must have missed it though). I didn't miss it,but Amazon has proven they are wonderful when it comes to taking care of their customers if they feel there was an error or communication problem.

1,Worst food ever,"As a vet tech with tens years experience it is my opinion that this is the worst dog food on the market. Yes, of course dogs love it, just like people love greasy, terrible-for-us fast food. In general, people should choose foods that contain only a few ingredients, and as little soy as possible, especially if your pet has any GI problems or any sort of allergies (which mostly manifest as red, itchy, gunky ears), and if so, corn, wheat, and even chicken may be a problem as well. Getting your pet on a better diet will make them happier and healthier and will reduce vet bills.",Negative,vet tech ten year experience opinion worst dog food market yes course dog love like people love greasy terribleforus fast food general people choose food contain ingredient little soy possible especially pet gi problem sort allergy mostly manifest red itchy gunky ear corn wheat even chicken may problem well getting pet better diet make happier healthier reduce vet bill

5,Only Brand I now Recommend,"I have used Premium Edge Lamb Formula dry dog food for years.  While many dog food manufacturers use real lamb - and not lamb meal - in their adult formulas, this is the ONLY manufacturer that uses real lamb in its Puppy Formula as well.  Hounds have sensitive stomaches and lamb digests best without upsetting their stomaches.  It also promotes a shiny, healthy coat while minimizing shedding and flakey skin conditions that are experienced by some breeds.  The food nuggets are small in size and appropriate for all breeds and sizes of dogs; the nutritional values are the highest or on level with that of many so-called ""premium"" brands - and better than that of some.  I have fed Premium Edge Lamb - both adult and puppy - to my Salukis for 12 years and heartily recommend it.  Read the order of ingredients in your pet's food; they are listed in the order of most to least included in the product.

5,"Rich and flavorful - even from the ""wrong"" pot!","I found a brick of Lavazza Crema e Gusto at a local shop some months ago, and tried it in my stovetop espresso maker. For some reason I thought the grind was what I needed (it *does* have a picture of a stovetop machine on it!) but the grind is really very fine, more like what a professional-type machine needs.<br /><br />But this works even in my <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001DJT7G"">Bialetti Brikka 4-Cup Stovetop Percolator</a> stovetop machine, and generates a beautiful crema. The Brikka really wants a slightly coarser grind, so I have to be *very* careful to put in the coffee with a light touch, and not to pack it down even a tiny bit.<br /><br />The flavor, as others have written, is very rich without being too dark-roasted, with lovely chocolatey notes. Bitterness can come if I overfill the maker so that the coffee is packed too hard, which causes boiling and burning. So care must be taken when using a stovetop maker. But it's truly worth it, because it gives such delicious coffee.",Positive,found brick lavazza crema e gusto local shop month ago tried stovetop espresso maker reason thought grind needed picture stovetop machine grind really fine like professionaltype machine needsbut work even bialetti brikka cup stovetop percolator stovetop machine generates beautiful crema brikka really want slightly coarser grind careful put coffee light touch pack even tiny bitthe flavor others written rich without darkroasted lovely chocolatey note bitterness come overfill maker coffee packed hard cause boiling burning care must taken using stovetop maker truly worth give delicious coffee

2,Good but maybe my package was old.,I thought that these bars were very tasty if a bit on the expensive side.  My main complaint is that the bars disintegrate as you open up the packaging. Since the bars are also very sticky remain stuck to the rapper as they break apart so you are stuck having to pick off pieces of the bar from the inside of the wrapper (which is difficult because the wrapper is plastic not foil). I don't know if I got an old box of these or if they're all like this. Regardless I probably won't risk getting another box like the first.,Negative,thought bar tasty bit expensive side main complaint bar disintegrate open packaging since bar also sticky remain stuck rapper break apart stuck pick piece bar inside wrapper difficult wrapper plastic foil dont know got old box theyre like regardless probably wont risk getting another box like first

1,"Maybe I'm being unfair because of my dark roast bias, but...","...this coffee tastes horrible.<br /><br />Having not learned my lesson to never look a gift horse in the mouth, I complain every chance I get about this smelly swill my employer buys to caffeinate the troops. In fact, it is this sort of indiscretion that lead me to bringing my own press pots, digital gram scale, and Costco french roast (yes, lowly mass-batched beans!) to work.<br /><br />If all you're looking for is a caffeine buzz, this will do the trick. But the cost is an acidic after taste that camps out on the tongue for the next few hours. Usually, I equate lighter roasts such as these with ""inoffensive,"" i.e. suitable for general audiences, including those who don't want a coffee to overwhelm them. Some (myself included) might even say ""bland.""  In acts of desperation when supplies are running low, I've supplemented my mellow dark roast with a scoop or two of this -- and its ""flavor"" adds a sour exclamation point that can't be masked.<br /><br />I'm not the only one who detests this brew: a few of my coworkers have similar sentiments, though are either too cheap to bring their own, or just aren't as passionate (aka abnormal) as I.

However, the last purchase, every one of the cans I opened was very lightly packed, about one third liver and the rest just oil. Even worse, the liver had dark, grey spots that would turn my stomach just looking at them. Perhaps good cod liver has become a thing of the past, like many other delicacies. I would prefer if they just raised the price to whatever it needs to be to provide the quality that we deserve when we spend our hard earned money, or, if that's not possible, just let the fish live and make soyburgers or something.",Negative,favourite brand cod liver hard find toronto buy dozen time find however last purchase every one can opened lightly packed one third liver rest oil even worse liver dark grey spot would turn stomach looking perhaps good cod liver become thing past like many delicacy would prefer raised price whatever need provide quality deserve spend hard earned money thats possible let fish live make soyburgers something

I tried many teas to see if anything satisfied to replace for my morning joe. Nothing, truly, Nothing satisfied my taste buds, my comfort buttons...my need for a stimulating aroma. Until. . . I went back to my STASH Chai. Decaf as it is, it satisfies all my taste and aroma needs and we are now 7 months out and I declare myself fully De-coffee'd.

You don't feed as much as other foods and they started gaining weight on this at first, so I have to watch that.  But they look so healthy now!  I also get the canned Merrick food, which they get a spoonful of, along with the dry.  They love all the canned foods too.  I also wish Amazon would carry this food.

Again, great results.<br /><br />This sauce seems to take on a new flavor depending what you pair it with.

5,after 10 years my dog feels great!,"My dog is an 11 year old pitbull and has had a sensitive stomach, reoccurring chronic ear infections, and was always licking her paws since she was a puppy. She would get up to walk around and immediately throw up for no reason. This would happen sometimes several times a day. Her symptoms were similar to acid reflux in people.I took her to 3 different vets for these issues separately (never realizing they could all be connected). She was on nausea medications, antibiotics for her ears, and several different ear washes. Nothing completely cured any of her issues. After doing a lot of research, i came across Wellness white fish and sweet potato and couldn't be happier. Over a 10 day period, i slowly changed over her food from the Iams i had been feeding her. It has now been about 3 months and she is a completely different dog. Since fully switching over to this food, she hasn't thrown up once and she is no longer scratching at her ears. She has more energy and always wants to play. I no longer have to coax her into eating by mixing in wet food with the Iams. She wags her tail when she sees me filling her bowl now and eats right away. She even licks the bowl when she is done and looks at me for more. If your dog has any of the same symptoms my dog had, you should definitely give this food a try. It might not be a fix for every dog but it doesnt hurt to try. It worked for my dog!",Positive,dog year old pitbull sensitive stomach reoccurring chronic ear infection always licking paw since puppy would get walk around immediately throw reason would happen sometimes several time day symptom similar acid reflux peoplei took different vet issue separately never realizing could connected nausea medication antibiotic ear several different ear wash nothing completely cured issue lot research came across wellness white fish sweet potato couldnt happier day period slowly changed food iams feeding month completely different dog since fully switching food hasnt thrown longer scratching ear energy always want play longer coax eating mixing wet food iams wag tail see filling bowl eats right away even lick bowl done look dog symptom dog definitely give food try might fix every dog doesnt hurt try worked dog

5,Superb Pancake/Waffle Mix,"For years, for all of my waffles and pancakes, I bought this in specialty stores until even they stopped selling it in deference to Classic Fare Belgian Waffle Mix, which, to me, has no flavor.  When I finally found this, I pounced but hated having to buy so much.  But at least I now have it.  Certainly keeps me from having to continue to make my own.

5,Dog Loves It,"I agree that the price on this is a bit high, but our dog loves it and still goes crazy whenever it's meal time.

2,Agravating K-Cups,"Well, I really wanted to like these but can't. The coffee itself was just ok. Faint smell of vanilla was there as was the taste. My biggest problem with these was the fact that about 1 in 4 plugged up my brewer. I had to take out the K-Cup carriage and stick a paperclip through the hole in the probe that pierces the bottom of the cup due to coffee grounds plugging it up. It seems that the built-in filter in these is bad because the grounds come out and plug the machine. I have tried many other K-Cups and these are the only ones that have ever done that.",Negative,well really wanted like cant coffee ok faint smell vanilla taste biggest problem fact plugged brewer take kcup carriage stick paperclip hole probe pierce bottom cup due coffee ground plugging seems builtin filter bad ground come plug machine tried many kcups one ever done

She also says they taste acidic to her. I drink my coffee with milk, so they taste fine to me and and I've had no problems, but I have a mostly cast-iron stomach anyway.<br /><br />So they're sitting on the shelf right now and we're drinking other kinds of coffee that don't give my wife nausea, pain, or heartburn.<br /><br />If you have a sensitive stomach, be careful.

5,Surprisingly Versatile,"Mayonnaise is something I usually associate with salads, (read boring rubbish here, in my opinion). However, I have been surprised just how much it is used in Japanese food.<br /><br />Although you can use it with normal salads, I have also enjoyed it very much with takoyaki, (octopus dumplings in a ball shape). It also mixes well with other sauces, such as with Japanese barbeque and so on.

I read where people have asked about being worried that more holes would be punched in the bottom of the k-cup, but you can just place the k-cup back in the holder and gently turn it until it pops back into the original hole from the first use.

I am not sure if the tea builds up in your system and stops working or if it is just me.  The tea does not have a bad taste, doable for its purpose.

5,Excellent!,"I don't generally crave candy or sweets that often, but if I have a weakness, it's sour lemon-flavored candy.  Here's the problem: I can never find one that satisfies me.<br /><br />Until now!  I have bought all sorts of different brands and types of sour lemon candies, in a bit of a ""search for the Holy Grail"" quest, and I believe I've found it.  These are absolutely great from start to finish.  They are sour all the way through, not like other candies that are coated with sour sugar, which gives you about 15 seconds of sour, and then are super-sweet the rest of the way.<br /><br />Everything about these is great, they're not too big and not too small.  And there's a bonus waiting for you in the middle:  A section of extra-sour lemony goodness that'll make ya pucker a little.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, these aren't annoying sour, like Warheads (which again, only are sour on the outside), but they are certainly have more kick than, say, your average lemon drop by Brach's or similar products.<br /><br />I recently got my order of 2 lbs. of these, which will last me a while, but I will certainly be re-ordering these again when I run out.  I've shared these with other lemon-loving friends of mine and they have all agreed on the quality.<br /><br />The only con:  They are slightly pricey, but I feel like I got my money's worth so I would absolutely buy these again.",Positive,dont generally crave candy sweet often weakness sour lemonflavored candy here problem never find one satisfies meuntil bought sort different brand type sour lemon candy bit search holy grail quest believe ive found absolutely great start finish sour way like candy coated sour sugar give second sour supersweet rest wayeverything great theyre big small there bonus waiting middle section extrasour lemony goodness thatll make ya pucker littledont get wrong arent annoying sour like warhead sour outside certainly kick say average lemon drop brachs similar productsi recently got order lb last certainly reordering run ive shared lemonloving friend mine agreed qualitythe con slightly pricey feel like got money worth would absolutely buy

5,Hands Down The Best Bold K-Cup of Coffee!,"I stumbled across these on Amazon, and since I was looking for a cheaper alternative to the usual 50 cent K-Cup, I figured I would give these a try - Am I glad I did!!<br /><br />For me at least, one of the issues with the Keurig K-Cup is that most make a cup of coffee that is too weak, especially if you want a larger cup.  This Fog Lifter brand does not.  The flavor is perfect, no bitterness and the strength is even good at the highest setting on my Keurig (travel mug size).  I only add a little heavy whipping cream to my coffee and it is the best (if you have never tried ""heavy whipping cream"", give it a shot), you don't know what your are missing, yes, it has fat, but no carbs, no sugars.<br /><br />Anyway I knew these were not traditional K-Cup, but who cares, in fact, I think this design is far superior.  The filter material is a bit thicker than the normal K-Cup paper filter, so the fact that the coffee does not drip through a single hole, does not matter, the flavor is still great.  The only thing that would make these better would be if they came in resealable bags, but then the price would go up.  I either just cut the corner off of the bag, then seal it with a plastic chip clip, or lately I have been buying Davidsons Tea.  The tea comes in a large foil-paper resealable bag.

5,Loves Snackwells,"After loosing well over 50 lbs on Weight Watchers, and being a cookie lover, I found that snackwells offer a good choice for a cookie craving.

5,Tassimo Maxwell House French roast,"My wife and I were a bit freaked when Starbucks announced it was no longer being sold in Tassimo (well, you can still buy them at historic prices as their supply must be near zero).  But Maxwell House French Roast more than amply fills the void where Starbuck's House blend used to occupy.  Good, rich, robust, strong cup of coffee!

2,weird combination of flavors,"I guess this is a personal opinion, but I don't particulary like the taste of this.

5,Pre-Workout Supplement (Caffeine Free),"I recently ordered this product and can say that I am extremely pleased with the results. The taste is good, albeit strong; I recommend taking it with a generous portion of water. The creatine in it makes it easy to get your daily requirement and perhaps the most note-able ingredient in this is the endo-thermogens. I noticed that the rate at which I sweated had increased significantly and I was very hungry after my workout (I'm pretty sure that that is a good thing). As for the energy, I am sure that a caffeine product would give me more energy, but I would rather not become dependent upon stimulants such as that. With that in mind, I can say that I have more energy when working out to do more reps. I have seen significant strength gains in the three weeks I have spent using this product; my squat has gone up more than 50 pounds, deadlift about 20, bench about 10, and Preacher Curls an amazing 20 pounds!! Finally, I have noticed better pumps since starting it. Overall, I can say that I would definitely buy this product another time, and for the price you get quite a good amount of it. My only complaint is that on the second day during which I used it, I experienced some minor digestive problems; although it caused me little discomfort.",Positive,recently ordered product say extremely pleased result taste good albeit strong recommend taking generous portion water creatine make easy get daily requirement perhaps noteable ingredient endothermogens noticed rate sweated increased significantly hungry workout im pretty sure good thing energy sure caffeine product would give energy would rather become dependent upon stimulant mind say energy working rep seen significant strength gain three week spent using product squat gone pound deadlift bench preacher curl amazing pound finally noticed better pump since starting overall say would definitely buy product another time price get quite good amount complaint second day used experienced minor digestive problem although caused little discomfort
3,Good price but check packaging,"I bought these for gifts, so I can't speak on the quality of the tea. However, I will say of the 4 I ordered, 3 of the tins had minor scuff marks or dents/dings, and one had rust on the outside. I kept it because there was no time to order another.

4,Spicy Thai,"When I saw the Spicy Thai chips, I knew i had to try them. I love spicy and I love Thai food, so why not? First off, these chips are not super spicy. They actually taste sort of sweet at first, with many degrees of flavor. The spiciness is more of a lingering taste that bites afterwards. I'd say these are definitely a good, unique chip. But if you absolutely hate sweet chips, I'd try a different flavor since these are a little sweet.",Positive,saw spicy thai chip knew try love spicy love thai food first chip super spicy actually taste sort sweet first many degree flavor spiciness lingering taste bite afterwards id say definitely good unique chip absolutely hate sweet chip id try different flavor since little sweet
4,Great drinking water,"I'm not really a bottled water expert, but this stuff was good.  I like the 1.5 Liter size.  It's large, but not uncontrollable.

5,Yummy!!!!,I always like to keep a box of energy bar in the office. I tried many different brands and larabar is one of the brands I like best.

5,Sweet and yummy,"The taste is lovely and mild.  I have had some barrels that contain a strong herbaceous flavor.  This is not that category.  The<br />flavor is true root beer, and does not fade.  I can only describe the flavor as sweet, mellow.  These barrels are smaller than some<br />others and fit in your mouth easily.  My only beef was with the wrapping.  For some reason the paper stuck to the barrel in little,<br />easy to miss spots.  I ended up with unpleasant shards of plastic in my mouth and got my fingers all sticky and sugary trying to retrieve the tiny masses.

5,The dog seems to enjoy it,"My dog is a bit of a jerk. She won't eat a lot of foods, and we've narrowed it down to basically Purnia products. But as she ages, we had to switch to a bit of a healthier choice for food. All of them she turned her head down at. Except for Beneful. I obviously cannot speak to how it takes, but the texture and variety of shapes looks as appealing as dog food can. My dog seems to enjoy it, whereas before she required gravy or some wet food to get her meal down, she can eat this without it. She seems to go to do her business more regularly, and her movements are more solid and seem healthier.",Positive,dog bit jerk wont eat lot food weve narrowed basically purnia product age switch bit healthier choice food turned head except beneful obviously speak take texture variety shape look appealing dog food dog seems enjoy whereas required gravy wet food get meal eat without seems go business regularly movement solid seem healthier
3,Basic Lemon Ginger Herbal Tea,"***<br />Stash's Lemon Ginger Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is a basic lemon ginger tea, tasting strongly of ginger, and full of flavorings, and oddly, even contains soy. This is one of the better commercial highly processed, non-organic teas. I much prefer organic teas that are made without artificial flavorings and certainly without soy, but if you are not picky about herb teas, and are looking something very strongly flavored as an introduction to the world of teasans and decaffeinated beverages, this would be fine. If you like your tea more subtle, with true pure tastes, and can discern complex differences between natural and commercial teas, then this definitely is not for you, and I would recommend any Numi tea, Yogi Tea, Traditional Medicinals, or even Stash's organic line of teas (which comes in a wonderful Lemon Ginger Organic Tea!)<br /><br />Stash Lemon Ginger Tea contains ginger root, lemongrass, lemon flavor, safflower, hibiscus, citric acid, and soy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, nothing special.<br />***",Neutral,stash lemon ginger caffeine free herbal tea basic lemon ginger tea tasting strongly ginger full flavoring oddly even contains soy one better commercial highly processed nonorganic tea much prefer organic tea made without artificial flavoring certainly without soy picky herb tea looking something strongly flavored introduction world teasans decaffeinated beverage would fine like tea subtle true pure taste discern complex difference natural commercial tea definitely would recommend numi tea yogi tea traditional medicinals even stash organic line tea come wonderful lemon ginger organic teastash lemon ginger tea contains ginger root lemongrass lemon flavor safflower hibiscus citric acid soyunfortunately nothing special
3,"It's Ok... Not for ""nosey"" people :)","I understand that the product does not guarantee increase in milk production, that is why I can't complain that it did not or helped in any way.

1,Should advertise coconut as an ingredient more prominently,"First, these should be called Mac - Coconut bars, as Coconut is the #2 ingredient and Mango is #3.

2,good idea but....,"Hormel has came up with another shelf stable product. Of course to make it last over a year on the shelf it has to have lots of preservitive ingredients. I sampled one and found they are very salty and tastless.

They are still on the shelf, and I will probably wind up trying to get rid of them at a loss or give away.",Negative,hormel came another shelf stable product course make last year shelf lot preservitive ingredient sampled one found salty tastless bought thinking would sell little store sell mostly senior citizen convienant senior citizen prepare quick dinner wrong still shelf probably wind trying get rid loss give away

Be careful if you bring these to the dog park.  You'll quickly develop a flock of fans!",Positive,others reviewer mentioned really stink however dog seems like odor good training careful bring dog park youll quickly develop flock fan
3,It doesn't taste like Colombian,"I found this roast a bit bitter and too dark to be Colombian.  It also tasted oily, something that the regular Colombian from Folger's is not.  I was a little disappointed.  Now that the price for this three-pack has doubled since May 2010 it's even less appealing.<br /><br />If I want a bold, dark roast I'll brew some French roast.

5,Tasty Iced Tea,"After reading the reviews, I thought I might give this tea a try, and I am glad I did.  I love iced tea, but I have always made it with tea bags.

2,Not great for nut milk,"I bought this bag along with another nut milk bag to compare them. This bag busted open at the seams after using it twice. The other bag I purchased was made of thin mesh material. It is still going strong after dozens of uses. This bag might work great for sprouting beans, but I would not recommend it for nut milk.",Negative,bought bag along another nut milk bag compare bag busted open seam using twice bag purchased made thin mesh material still going strong dozen us bag might work great sprouting bean would recommend nut milk

I love this stuff so much I went back and purchased all that they had ($1.25 a tube!)along with the Napoleon pesto in a tube for the same price.  These products are so handy and very yummy!  For a quick appetizer for unexpected company, I will toast some french bread... smear it with EVOO, the garlic paste, the pesto.  Add some sliced tomatoes and basil leaves if handy and top off with some shredded cheese you have on hand... parmesan, asiago, etc.  Broil for a few minutes.  Takes all of 2 minutes to prepare and another couple to broil and you are done!  I am delighted to find that Amazon carries it as it has become a major staple in my pantry.

They are good with soup, spaghetti-o's, dinner, lunch, etc.  I like them cold, sliced on a salad or in a sandwitch with lettuce, tomato, etc.  There is no meat in these, so you don't need to cook them.  They can also be used in most ways hot dogs can, except I don't think these taste that good boiled.  You can grill them, cut them into baked beans, roll them in Pillsbury Crescent rolls and bake, etc.  They are very versatile and a good source of protein that my kids will eat!",Positive,raised kid love usually heat microwave good soup spaghettios dinner lunch etc like cold sliced salad sandwitch lettuce tomato etc meat dont need cook also used way hot dog except dont think taste good boiled grill cut baked bean roll pillsbury crescent roll bake etc versatile good source protein kid eat

5,delicious and nutritious!,"Kettle's hickory honey BBQ chips are fantastic! There are a lot of snacks on the market that are supposedly healthier alternatives to their full-fat counterparts, but in my experience, reducing the ""bad stuff"" usually causes similar reductions in taste and quality. Moreover, in cutting out the fat, almost every snack adds artificial sweeteners, fillers, preservatives, or fat substitutes, nearly all of which can be health concerns for consumers. (For example, any product with sucralose/Splenda in it makes me extremely ill!)<br /><br />However, with Kettle's chips, consumers can easily identify all of the ingredients in the package, and in the baked chips, you can essentially eat an entire bag for about the same amount of fat you'll find in a single serving of most other brands of chips. Even better, the BBQ flavor is really great in these chips, ensuring that your snack is really satisfying and truly filling your cravings. I love the fact that more salty snack options are appearing on the market, and I hope that Kettle continues its trend of producing simple, healthy, and absolutely tasty products. I guarantee that chip lovers will not be disappointed by this yummy offering...",Positive,kettle hickory honey bbq chip fantastic lot snack market supposedly healthier alternative fullfat counterpart experience reducing bad stuff usually cause similar reduction taste quality moreover cutting fat almost every snack add artificial sweetener filler preservative fat substitute nearly health concern consumer example product sucralosesplenda make extremely illhowever kettle chip consumer easily identify ingredient package baked chip essentially eat entire bag amount fat youll find single serving brand chip even better bbq flavor really great chip ensuring snack really satisfying truly filling craving love fact salty snack option appearing market hope kettle continues trend producing simple healthy absolutely tasty product guarantee chip lover disappointed yummy offering

3,Lots of crunch with a hint of flavor,"When perusing the cereal aisle, there are a LOT of choices these days. Some are clearly NOT good for you, some are, and some are just OK. You aren't going to be on a 3-hour sugar buzz, but neither are you really doing yourself that huge of a favor. Perhaps you are one of those who thought Raisin Bran was good for you... until you found out it has more sugar than Fruit Loops!<br /><br />Enter Quaker Oatmeal Squares, in this case infused with ""a hint"" of cinnamon. My first two thoughts are 1) must be good for you if it's from Quaker Oats! and 2) mmm... cinnamon!<br /><br />Bottom line: IF you sweeten it a bit, this cereal is good and crunchy at first. It does NOT have an overwhelming cinnamon flavor, and in some ways is a bit bland. But the flavor is acceptable. The crunch will wear off quickly, though, if you let it soak for more than a couple of minutes.<br /><br />The pitch is that ""each square has cinnamon baked into it"". Well, honestly, does it matter if it's baked in or sprinkled on? I think it could use a bit more flavor, but that's mostly just my opinion. Others may find it just right. The cereal consists of 46 grams of whole grains per serving, so that part is good. If you are going to consume cereal, you should consume those made with whole grains. It also packs a decent amount of soluble fiber (5g) and protein (6g - high for a dry cereal). There are 210 calories in a 1 cup serving of Quaker Oatmeal Squares Cereal (Cinnamon). The caloric breakdown is: 10% fat, 79% carbs, 11% protein. The cereal has 9g of sugar per serving.<br /><br />So if you're a cereal eater and looking for something healthier than Cap'n Crunch, this is probably a ""better"" selection. That said, I caution anyone against starting their day with a ton of carbohydrates, especially those derived from sugary sources. And as with anything, be aware of what a ""serving"" is and practice moderation. If not measured out, many folks would potentially consume 2-3 servings (in this case cups) in a single bowl, which would equate to a quick 400-600 calories just for breakfast!",Neutral,perusing cereal aisle lot choice day clearly good ok arent going hour sugar buzz neither really huge favor perhaps one thought raisin bran good found sugar fruit loopsenter quaker oatmeal square case infused hint cinnamon first two thought must good quaker oat mmm cinnamonbottom line sweeten bit cereal good crunchy first overwhelming cinnamon flavor way bit bland flavor acceptable crunch wear quickly though let soak couple minutesthe pitch square cinnamon baked well honestly matter baked sprinkled think could use bit flavor thats mostly opinion others may find right cereal consists gram whole grain per serving part good going consume cereal consume made whole grain also pack decent amount soluble fiber g protein g high dry cereal calorie cup serving quaker oatmeal square cereal cinnamon caloric breakdown fat carbs protein cereal g sugar per servingso youre cereal eater looking something healthier capn crunch probably better selection said caution anyone starting day ton carbohydrate especially derived sugary source anything aware serving practice moderation measured many folk would potentially consume serving case cup single bowl would equate quick calorie breakfast

3,"Very Hard, Don't try as finger food for those without Molars","I saw these in store and picked one up to try, I didn't see any obvious suggested age on the packaging so I thought they would be a healthy finger food for my toddler but they turned out to be really hard (even after soaking in milk for a minute or more they were still hard!). I don't think these are suitable for kids without molars to grind them down OR toddlers who are good at mashing things up with their gums. They are a size of about a small grape so perfect as a chocking hazard.

5,My favorite Mocktails flavor,"Crystal Light Mocktails Appletini<br />The Appletini has a taste and smell reminiscent of the green apple Jolly Rancher candy, but not as sweet.

4,excellant rice milk product,"We have been using Better than Milk Vanilla for some time and we really like the taste.  You can adjust the consistancy by changing the water to milk ratio.  It is always better to mix it up a day before using as the product will totally disolve by then.  Our only complaint is that the product is hard to mix, disolve into the water.  It takes a lot of hard shaking (my wife can't do it) to get the milk to disolve.  You can get it pretty well mixed when making it and finish the next day.",Positive,using better milk vanilla time really like taste adjust consistancy changing water milk ratio always better mix day using product totally disolve complaint product hard mix disolve water take lot hard shaking wife cant get milk disolve get pretty well mixed making finish next day
5,Inexpensive alternative to whole nuts,"We bought these because the whole/half Macadamia nut products from Mauna Loa were not available at that time from Amazon.  Adding a little sea salt, they taste just as good, and as a side benefit, the cost is a lot less.  But about the same per ounce as the 24 oz. whole Mauna Loa Dry Roasted Macadamias with Sea Salt from Costco, when they have them in stock.)<br /><br />The Amazon ""Product Features"" say these are lightly salted, but that's not true, as you can see from the ""Nutritional Information"" the sodium content is 0 mg.",Positive,bought wholehalf macadamia nut product mauna loa available time amazon adding little sea salt taste good side benefit cost lot less per ounce oz whole mauna loa dry roasted macadamia sea salt costco stockthe amazon product feature say lightly salted thats true see nutritional information sodium content mg

5,He LOVES them!,"Our 5½ year old Carolina Dog (if you don't know what they are - Google them - they're fascinating!) absolutely loves these.  He's very polite, never whining or insisting for ""just one more"" of anything - until now.  From the first one, he almost refused to just eat one.  They're small, handy, and almost smell good enough to eat for humans (if you like things like Hickory Farms smoked sausage).  And the ingredients are excellent - not just a bunch of grain fillers.  We won't feed our dog (or previous dogs) ""junk"" snacks.  Will we get these again?  You bet!  I've never seen any of our dogs go for a ""treat"" like ours has with these.  Our reviews only get 5 stars if they're truly superior - and this easily rates the full 5.",Positive,year old carolina dog dont know google theyre fascinating absolutely love he polite never whining insisting one anything first one almost refused eat one theyre small handy almost smell good enough eat human like thing like hickory farm smoked sausage ingredient excellent bunch grain filler wont feed dog previous dog junk snack get bet ive never seen dog go treat like review get star theyre truly superior easily rate full
4,Great taste - difficult to measure,"Love the taste, but a 'squeeze' is hard to measure. A quick squeeze, a full squeeze, a short squeeze, a long squeeze?<br /><br />I bought MiO to flavor the occasional water bottle while hiking. I'm glad I tried it at home first. The directions state one 'squeeze' ( ½ teaspoon) per 8 oz. Even if you can perfect your ½ teaspoon squeeze (or carry a ½ teaspoon with you), another size glass or bottle adds difficulty. I use the little-squeeze-then-taste method, adding more little squeezes and sips until I have the perfect taste. I sure would prefer a less trial-and-error approach, but this method works for any quantity of water where the pre-measured powder packets don't.<br /><br />Once you perfect the amount of MiO to add to your water, it does taste great. I actually like having the water colored so I know which water bottle is flavored and which isn't.<br /><br />The label recommends use within one month of opening, which may be a few too many servings (24) of one flavor for an individual, but great for sharing with family or others. For my hiking and other more solitary uses, I'll go with the longer shelf life of individual serving powdered mixes for variety.",Positive,love taste squeeze hard measure quick squeeze full squeeze short squeeze long squeezei bought mio flavor occasional water bottle hiking im glad tried home first direction state one squeeze teaspoon per oz even perfect teaspoon squeeze carry teaspoon another size glass bottle add difficulty use littlesqueezethentaste method adding little squeeze sip perfect taste sure would prefer less trialanderror approach method work quantity water premeasured powder packet dontonce perfect amount mio add water taste great actually like water colored know water bottle flavored isntthe label recommends use within one month opening may many serving one flavor individual great sharing family others hiking solitary us ill go longer shelf life individual serving powdered mix variety
5,"Nice flavor gum, your dentist will like it too!","This gum has an interesting, vibrant peppermint flavor. I liked it as it wasn't overpowering, but it was still nicely minty. It also had a nice ""mouth feel"" not being too hard to too soft.<br /><br />I didn't notice anything out of the ginseng part. But then again, I chew quite a bit of peppermint gum, so I got it for the sugar-free peppermint part, not the ginseng part.<br /><br />Comes in a nice package that will protect the gum, but still has a slightly modern look. One quibble- it comes in packs of nine, not a dozen as is more common.<br /><br />Chewing sugar-free gum between and after meals is very good for dental hygiene.  Not as good as brushing, sure, but it's a handy way to help keep your teeth and breath fresh.",Positive,gum interesting vibrant peppermint flavor liked wasnt overpowering still nicely minty also nice mouth feel hard softi didnt notice anything ginseng part chew quite bit peppermint gum got sugarfree peppermint part ginseng partcomes nice package protect gum still slightly modern look one quibble come pack nine dozen commonchewing sugarfree gum meal good dental hygiene good brushing sure handy way help keep teeth breath fresh
5,The most bang for the buck for your daily cuppa,"Lipton Yellow Label is CTC (crush, tear, curl) processed black Indian tea. Lipton makes it for the UK and India markets where folks take their tea with milk and sugar. CTC tea looks a little like coarse coffee grounds, and it brews quickly into a dark robust liquor that can stand up to milk and sugar. Some tea drinkers say the process gains heartiness, but at the cost subtlety and perfume.<br />  CTC makes a stronger brew than leaf tea or (ewww) tea bags. Start with ¾ tsp of Yellow Label per cup, and steep for just three minutes, and adjust to taste next time. I find a second extraction (six-minute steep) to be quite drinkable. Again, a matter of taste.<br />  I settled on Yellow Label for my daily cuppa after trying several kinds of leaf tea over the years. I also tried Tetley, another CTC blend, but found it one-dimensional and heavy. Single-estate leaf teas still delight my Inner Tea Snob, but their cost makes them occasional treats, not daily tipples.<br />  And it's on the scale of value for money where Yellow Label is a clear winner. I know of no other tea in its price range that tastes as good. Yes, you can find teas that offer more complexity, subtlety and bouquet - for a lot more money.<br />  If you're looking for a daily cuppa that delivers real tea satisfaction for just pennies a cup, it's hard to go wrong with Yellow Label. Start with the one-lb box (about $11). Two two-lb boxes ($35) are even better value, but that's a year's worth of tea in my house.",Positive,lipton yellow label ctc crush tear curl processed black indian tea lipton make uk india market folk take tea milk sugar ctc tea look little like coarse coffee ground brew quickly dark robust liquor stand milk sugar tea drinker say process gain heartiness cost subtlety perfume ctc make stronger brew leaf tea e tea bag start tsp yellow label per cup steep three minute adjust taste next time find second extraction sixminute steep quite drinkable matter taste settled yellow label daily cuppa trying several kind leaf tea year also tried tetley another ctc blend found onedimensional heavy singleestate leaf tea still delight inner tea snob cost make occasional treat daily tipple scale value money yellow label clear winner know tea price range taste good yes find tea offer complexity subtlety bouquet lot money youre looking daily cuppa delivers real tea satisfaction penny cup hard go wrong yellow label start onelb box two twolb box even better value thats year worth tea house

I myself use those refillable cups that one can find on amazon.  I have a half dozen of them.  I fill them with grocery store cheap brand and set my Keurig for the 6oz expresso cup.  It makes great strong coffee.  My wife on the other hand is lazy and doesn't want to mess with the two seconds it takes to fill the refillable little baskets.  She loves the Green Mountain Extra bold and as I buy it for her she doesn't care how much it costs.  It's good coffee and keeps my wife of forty years off my back.

Even better, it has the perfect amount of caffeine for me--just enough to wake me up without making me sweaty and jittery like coffee does.<br /><br />The individually-wrapped, foil-packaged tea bags are convenient, even if that much packaging does seem like overkill.

Its peanuts mixed with oil.  So what if its Organic.  If I want Organic peanut butter, I want it made out of peanuts.  I got crunchy, because I love the nuts in crunchy peanut butter.

2,No better than Campbell's,"I'm reviewing the Organic Chicken and Egg Noodles soup.  I'm puzzled by the reviews that rave about the soup -- the only thing I can think of is that perhaps they are reviewing different kinds.  This particular soup is not worth the money.  You will need to get a magnifying glass to see the chicken.  The egg noodles are ""okay.""  You'll get lots of water and celery, so if you like that, then this is for you.  The flavor is good, but not better than the various canned soups you buy at the grocery store.

5,sweet honey caramels + vitamins = thinking energy,"These Energy Plus candies are really tasty.  They taste like a hard caramel which eventually gives way to a soft honey center.  They have a modest amount of vitamins in each drop: 33% of your daily recommended value of two of your B vitamins and also C.  I don't notice any vitamin flavor, which is nice.<br /><br />The sugar content is pretty moderate (5 gm), mostly because you are spending a long time sucking on a small portion.<br /><br />I enjoy having these around during my work day.  I find that small hard candies are a nice little treat and energy boost throughout the day (for long days doing computer work, in my case).<br /><br />Likes:<br />- Very tasty.<br />- Moderate sugar and calories (10 minutes of enjoyment for 5 gm sugar and 20 calories).<br />- B vitamins give me an energy boost.<br />- Natural ingredients:  Sugar, corn syrup, milk, honey, butter, natural flavors, B + C vitamins.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />- The gooey center is a personal preference..

5,Good coffee,"Most of the reviews I have read were pretty much how the coffee tasted to people. Since everyone's taste is different, I think it's a moot point. What is important is how fresh the coffee is. I found that each cup had the same freshness so that's a nod to consistency. As for my own personal taste preferences, I drank Folgers Classic Roast for years and since that isn't available in K cup, I've been drinking the Caribou Coffee blend as a replacement. It tastes fine to me and the caffeine keeps me going all day.  I haven't had any problems with using the Caribou Coffee K cup either.

I purchased 3 boxes after the initial sample and after a few months I'm still not tired of the flavor.

4,"Good stuff, needs experimentation","I've been looking for a decent instant coffee, and since I like Greek coffee, decided to give this a try.  Long story short, it's not bad stuff -- but since I don't read Greek, it's taken a lot of experimentation with amounts to get the amounts right.  I find that if I don't use enough of the instant granules, I get a thin acidic cup, so I personally use about two tablespoons per cup of hot water.<br /><br />Remember that this is intended to taste like strong Greek coffee, not drip-brew, and is best taken with sugar, no cream.  I normally take my coffee black, but this doesn't taste quite right to me without a little sugar.",Positive,ive looking decent instant coffee since like greek coffee decided give try long story short bad stuff since dont read greek taken lot experimentation amount get amount right find dont use enough instant granule get thin acidic cup personally use two tablespoon per cup hot waterremember intended taste like strong greek coffee dripbrew best taken sugar cream normally take coffee black doesnt taste quite right without little sugar

Years later, by forcing myself to love it, I now am addicted.  You can learn to love this stuff.  And with its many muscle revitalizing and cholesterol healing properties, you can too.  Coconut water reportedly has a unique long-form cholesterol that helps regulate bad cholesterol, among other healing properties.  Not a low calorie food, are you kidding?  This is nothing compared to juice, tea, soda, etc..  The only natural drinks that have it beat on calories are black coffee and tea. This product is not from concentrate and tastes delicious.

1,Tasted like Rear End to me,"I am very sorry to say this tasted to me the way I imagine ""rear end"" would taste. I tried refrigerating them to make it more palatable. For some reason there was a very strong bran-like taste as the most dominant flavor, with sweet and chocolate as the secondary and tertiary flavors in that order. I assume it was from the brown rice. I agree with another reviewer that they are very sweet, though since I cooked them in mini cupcake form it was not a significant problem for me. I tried for several weeks (including refrigerating and freezing) to try and finish them without wasting them, but I finally gave up. I was so worried I gave away my other untried products (carrot cake mix etc.) from this company. I didn't dare try the rest, as brown rice was listed as a primary ingredient again.",Negative,sorry say tasted way imagine rear end would taste tried refrigerating make palatable reason strong branlike taste dominant flavor sweet chocolate secondary tertiary flavor order assume brown rice agree another reviewer sweet though since cooked mini cupcake form significant problem tried several week including refrigerating freezing try finish without wasting finally gave worried gave away untried product carrot cake mix etc company didnt dare try rest brown rice listed primary ingredient

4,Crunchy Peanutty Flavor,"This is a very tasty cereal, but I find it a bit too sweet for my liking. The Os look similar to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VZ7W52"">Honey Nut Cheerios</a>, but they taste more like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YPOEF8"">Cap'n Crunch Peanut Butter Crunch</a>. In terms of sugar content Crunchy Nut is comparable to Honey Nut Cheerios (about 10 g each) so if you like that amount of sugar in your cereal then the choice between these two will come down to taste. The little pieces of nuts that are embedded in each O are hardly noticeable, both visually and in terms of the overall taste. It turns out that these are technically speaking not really nuts, but rather peanuts. They mostly have an effect in terms of the overall flavor - the combination of corn/oats and peanut pieces is probably responsible for the peanut-buttery taste. The Os are indeed very crunchy, and they are among the crunchiest cereals that I have ever tried. They don't lose this crunchiness easily even after a minute or two of soaking in milk. Crunchy Nut Os also make a very tasty and convenient snack. I have also tried them with blueberries and the fruity flavor comes as a nice contrast to all the sugariness of this cereal. Overall, this is a very nice cereal but it's nothing spectacular.",Positive,tasty cereal find bit sweet liking o look similar honey nut cheerio taste like capn crunch peanut butter crunch term sugar content crunchy nut comparable honey nut cheerio g like amount sugar cereal choice two come taste little piece nut embedded hardly noticeable visually term overall taste turn technically speaking really nut rather peanut mostly effect term overall flavor combination cornoats peanut piece probably responsible peanutbuttery taste o indeed crunchy among crunchiest cereal ever tried dont lose crunchiness easily even minute two soaking milk crunchy nut o also make tasty convenient snack also tried blueberry fruity flavor come nice contrast sugariness cereal overall nice cereal nothing spectacular

5,Tastes great to me!,"Kraft Mac and Cheese has always been my go-to quick mac and cheese. Though there may be some subtle taste difference between this and the regular, I can't taste it and neither could my husband. There is only 1/2 serving of veggies per cup, but getting an extra half serving of veggies in your mac and cheese isn't such a bad deal, really (and if you mix in some peas or green beans, then you've got yourself a bit of a meal). (I think the real question here is if we should wonder if the federal regulations for saying something has a serving of vegetables/fruit have become too lax lately.)<br /><br />I'd definitely buy it again. I'm currently pregnant, so any place I can sneak in an extra vegetable serving (especially since so many normal foods don't appeal to me now) is good. And while I don't think this is the way to get your kids to eat their veggies, again it's not a bad way to get some extra in there.",Positive,kraft mac cheese always goto quick mac cheese though may subtle taste difference regular cant taste neither could husband serving veggie per cup getting extra half serving veggie mac cheese isnt bad deal really mix pea green bean youve got bit meal think real question wonder federal regulation saying something serving vegetablesfruit become lax latelyid definitely buy im currently pregnant place sneak extra vegetable serving especially since many normal food dont appeal good dont think way get kid eat veggie bad way get extra

An apartment doesn't have a place for an extra freezer so unfortunately a raw diet isn't feasible. This food is the closest to a raw diet you can get in a dry kibble. NO GRAIN and all meat proteins, exactly how cats want it. And like other reviewers commented, cats LOVE it. My cat always runs hopefully to his CORE storage bin when I start to open it and cries and begs until it is on his dish. My cat's coat is glossy, thick, healthy and barely sheds. His eyes are clear and bright. He has tons of energy and every year his vet is impressed with how healthy he is. No digestive problems, and no kidney problems that are so common in cats fed grain cat food.<br />I strongly recommend this cat food!",Positive,yet find superior dry cat food prefer feed cat raw diet sometimes isnt possible apartment doesnt place extra freezer unfortunately raw diet isnt feasible food closest raw diet get dry kibble grain meat protein exactly cat want like reviewer commented cat love cat always run hopefully core storage bin start open cry begs dish cat coat glossy thick healthy barely shed eye clear bright ton energy every year vet impressed healthy digestive problem kidney problem common cat fed grain cat foodi strongly recommend cat food

While I do want to eventually switch to using dried beans because I think that its less packaging and better price versus the canned, I am busy sometimes and find that to have some canned beans in the pantry on stock has been very helpful. The kidney beans in the can are nice big beans, and taste delicious.<br /><br />Kidney beans are great cold out of the can in salads with kale, red onion, avocado, and sprouts and I love them in soups!

5,I can have peanut butter again!,"This stuff sounded too good to be true, but I tried it anyhow, and WOW am I glad that I did! I usually eat PB2 as a snack spread on a chocolate Vitatop muffin. I mix 1 tablespoon (22 calories!) with just enough water to make a good spreadable consistency, and then spread it on the muffin top. So yummy! I'm not sure why there are 10 or so one-star reviews... I guess if you are looking for the creaminess of peanut butter, then you won't like this because it doesn't have any oil in it. It's also more like natural peanut butter and not like Jif or Peter Pan, which have lots of added sugar. The powder also tends to repel liquids, so you have to treat it a bit like flour if you want to mix it into something else. Start by mixing a small amount of water with the powder until it loses the powdery texture, then add the peanut powder/water mixture to your recipe.",Positive,stuff sounded good true tried anyhow wow glad usually eat pb snack spread chocolate vitatop muffin mix tablespoon calorie enough water make good spreadable consistency spread muffin top yummy im sure onestar review guess looking creaminess peanut butter wont like doesnt oil also like natural peanut butter like jif peter pan lot added sugar powder also tends repel liquid treat bit like flour want mix something else start mixing small amount water powder loses powdery texture add peanut powderwater mixture recipe

I am one who does NOT use egg nor white flour to mix in my pasta dough and I find this semolina to be extremely pliable. Not to mention the price here! I love the Italian-imported flours but it becomes way too costly because of the shipping. The fact that Amazon is offering FOUR BAGS of this flour for just over $12 is a steal!!!

There are a dozen other brands that I have tried and, speaking as a former Virginian, this one is at the summit.  They are so large, so crunchy, and so tasty that you will insist on EATING THEM ONE AT A TIME.  The Royal Oak container is still a 40-ounce can, which was once the industry standard.  Many competitors have slipped to 36 ounces or even 32.  Be careful when you select others.  You may not be buying the number of peanuts you expected.  Don't accept any peanuts that were canned over six months ago, as they could be stale.

2,Expensive and MESSY.,"I was buying <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002IYDXVE"">Enfamil Premium Lipil Single Serve Powder Packets 17.4 g Sticks, 16-Count Boxes (Pack of 2)</a>, they will make 4oz of formula and are in packages just like sports drinks...HOWEVER the packaging SUCKS. Baby formula does not pour well and can get caught in the tinest of wrinkle and then come rushing out when it makes it way past. It's very light and fluffy so spills go everywhere. The single serve sticks are also larger, longer in length and can take up space in your diaper bag, you can't fold them up it's just awkward all around, especially to pour them in the car or at the mall, etc. Not to mention EXPENSIVE. Really EXPENSIVE, 8 packs for $12-$16. Meaning 8 bottles for that, when a whole formula case is $25. MAKE YOUR OWN SINGLE SERVE SOLUTIONS! I really can't express to you how awful the packaging is on these, they spill every single time, I'm no butterfingers so I know it's not me. The tear wrong, the formula comes gushing out after you try to coax it down when it gets stuck no matter how hard you try to flatten it out before you open. All in all, this is a great idea in theory, it just fails in design.<br /><br />Here are two cheaper and more efficient solutions:<br /><br /> Most moms have and use either the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000RFCXIK"">Munchkin Powdered Formula Dispenser Combo Pack, Colors Vary</a> or a variant of it ( hear its not as good as this one and I believe it). We got a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006BAJIG"">Philips AVENT Formula BPA-Free Dispenser/Snack Cup</a>and I think it's excellent quality and wonderful, the dividers do not ""leak"" into each other at all since it's one piece mold, and you can just take it out if you want to use for snacks, it's a must have. That said, its so big in my diaper bag. I like to have as much room in my bag as I can, and every inch counts.<br /><br />So I got These plastic bags make it possible. Plus if I have sports powdered mixes, etc I can use these as well for myself.  Why not make your own single serve pouches? I looked into a few kinds and these <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002EDINH8"">500 Poly Bag Clear Zipper Shipping Bags 3"" X 4""</a> were the best economically, (bags for cost) I can pack 3 or 4 bottles worth in the same space that a pack of altoids would take up, less actually. About 2 or 3 on top of each other is the thickness of my iphone 4. I can fit about 8 bags inside the avent formula dispenser. This is way better than the size more conventional formula dispensers hold. The best way to pour it into your cup or baby bottle ( from experience ) is to pinch it at the ziplock seam, open it so that the left corner is touching the right corner, and pour it out. Never spill a drop, no mess all over the place, love it.<br /><br />That said I would NEVER Give up the avent formula dispenser, I actually bought another because I love using them at home. I sit these out on the counter and I don't have to clutter up the kitchen, plus when a baby sitter comes over I just tell her pour one compartment into the bottle and shake. I also fill up bottles of water and have them waiting at the ready so I practically have to  nothing to make a bottle when I am tired or relying on others. These are a must have. If you don't want to fuss with the baggies, I would say this is the best compact formula dispenser for your money and on the market, hands down it sweeps the competition. Don't buy the cheaper ones, their dividers SUCK and the lid is iffy. This is the one that works best. Also, the best way to pout it out and get it all out quick and fast is to line up the hole with the bottle and SHAKE SIDE TO SIDE Rapidly.

5,For the Love of Israeli couscous!,"This is the most versatile product that I've ever used. You can eat it by itself, mix it with vegetables, meat, herbs and/or, put it in soups or sauces. Israeli couscous tastes delicious, is not expensive, a little of it goes a long way and, it's easy to prepare. Israeli couscous is much different than the fine & grainy couscous that most people think of, and are used to, in reference to couscous. The pieces are much larger & heartier so they hold up under various cooking preparations. Israeli couscous has a mild flavor which makes it capable of adopting any flavor profile that you may desire---just like pasta (because it IS pasta) or rice. It is an awesome addition to any meal. Try Israeli Couscous---you'll be glad you did!",Positive,versatile product ive ever used eat mix vegetable meat herb andor put soup sauce israeli couscous taste delicious expensive little go long way easy prepare israeli couscous much different fine grainy couscous people think used reference couscous piece much larger heartier hold various cooking preparation israeli couscous mild flavor make capable adopting flavor profile may desirejust like pasta pasta rice awesome addition meal try israeli couscousyoull glad

1,Horrible Artificial Flavor,"This peach tea honestly tastes like it was flavored with peach-scented soap.  The tea itself is probably fine, but the flavoring that they used is overpowering and barely resembles peach flavor.  After I opened the package, a cheap, artificial peach scent filled the entire room, which was not bad in itself, but the soapy taste made this tea completely unacceptable.  It sounds cruel to say this, but the flavor of this tea is closer to peach shampoo than peach tea.",Negative,peach tea honestly taste like flavored peachscented soap tea probably fine flavoring used overpowering barely resembles peach flavor opened package cheap artificial peach scent filled entire room bad soapy taste made tea completely unacceptable sound cruel say flavor tea closer peach shampoo peach tea

5,The Classic Garden 7 Pod with Gourmet Herb AeroGarden,I bought the AeroGarden in hopes of starting my own indoor garden since I live in a highrise apartment and off the ground.  I also get the morning sun so growing plants on my balcony is hard to do.  I searched the internet in hopes of a indoor garden for myself and I came accross Amazon.com they had on their site the AeroGarden.  I purchased the AeroGarden and within a few days it arrived and wow!! I'm still impressed with it I put it together the same day I got it wich was March 31/11.  within the first 5 days I saw seedlings.  On April 22/11 I transplanted my plants into a flower pots.  I will purchase another 7 pod black AeroGarden again soon. I had a bit of a problem with setting the timer other than that it was eay to assemble.  I highly recommend the AeroGarden to anyone who wants to start their own indoor Garden.  The AeroGarden is the right thing to own it's the size of a meduim sized plant and it sits on a end table. I bought the Gourmet Herb seeds and I found that the Dill and Mint took the longest to grow but they did come through ok and now they are bigger then the other plants. I'm so happy that I got this AeroGarden it's the best investment I had ever made.,Positive,bought aerogarden hope starting indoor garden since live highrise apartment ground also get morning sun growing plant balcony hard searched internet hope indoor garden came accross amazoncom site aerogarden purchased aerogarden within day arrived wow im still impressed put together day got wich march within first day saw seedling april transplanted plant flower pot purchase another pod black aerogarden soon bit problem setting timer eay assemble highly recommend aerogarden anyone want start indoor garden aerogarden right thing size meduim sized plant sits end table bought gourmet herb seed found dill mint took longest grow come ok bigger plant im happy got aerogarden best investment ever made

4,Kyjen Dog Games Treat Wheel (Misc.),I have a 95lb pitbull/ mastiff mix that often loves his rope bone and his squeaker toy and thought it would be great to challenge him with some thinking toys.  I was a bit weary of this toy because my dog might chew up the plastic treat covers but found they are rather tough and that food incentive was greater than the chew incentive.  Overall it took about 10 minutes with the advice of the instructions and my pup was on his way to collecting treats from his new puzzle.  It takes him a few seconds now to pull the right cap off and start chowing on his goodies.  Another thing I would like to note is clean up is pretty easy.  I washed the tray and cups with hot water and soap and let dry next to the counter.<br /><br />This is a Social Writeup,Positive,lb pitbull mastiff mix often love rope bone squeaker toy thought would great challenge thinking toy bit weary toy dog might chew plastic treat cover found rather tough food incentive greater chew incentive overall took minute advice instruction pup way collecting treat new puzzle take second pull right cap start chowing goody another thing would like note clean pretty easy washed tray cup hot water soap let dry next counterthis social writeup

4,The thought of reviewing a doggie treat...,"I have to LOL a bit at the ""How do you rate this item?"" question for this review.  How would ""I"" rate the item?  Do ""I"" like it?  Uh, sure, I feel really emotional about this item and I absolutely love it, can't you just picture me sitting here chewing on one of these treat biscuits?<br /><br />I suppose I shouldn't joke too much here since there's been stories of some people eating dog food for years, but really, I'm the human in the animal+human equation here and my opinion really isn't the one that matters for this product.  What matters is what the doggie thinks, or how she seems to react to being given one of these treats.  It's here that things remain tough though as the family dog behaves like many dogs do -- if it's at all edible, and heck, for a lot of things that aren't (like her stuffed toys that all die quick deaths), she'll have it gone so quickly you question whether she ever even tasted whatever it was you gave her.<br /><br />With that said, these dry biscuits do tend to slow her down a little, at least compared to some of the other treats we might give her.  (For example: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OUOYH6"">Cardinal Laboratories Pet Botanics Training Rewards Treats, Beef 20 Ounces</a>).  Being dry, she's got to slow down a bit and crunch up these treats.  In our case, with a smaller dog (Pomeranian), she really has to crunch things up, even if we break these biscuits apart (they come as breakable bars with two smaller portions in each bar).  A larger dog wouldn't have that much work to do, or at least I doubt they would.  I'll find out a bit later as I intend to take a few of these treats over to my lady friend's house where her much bigger family dog can give them a try.<br /><br />Realistically, the Newman's Own brand is one that I enjoy supporting.  They have a good reputation for me and their products are always good.  These dog treats seem to be yet another good example of that.",Positive,lol bit rate item question review would rate item like uh sure feel really emotional item absolutely love cant picture sitting chewing one treat biscuitsi suppose shouldnt joke much since there story people eating dog food year really im human animalhuman equation opinion really isnt one matter product matter doggie think seems react given one treat thing remain tough though family dog behaves like many dog edible heck lot thing arent like stuffed toy die quick death shell gone quickly question whether ever even tasted whatever gave herwith said dry biscuit tend slow little least compared treat might give example cardinal laboratory pet botanics training reward treat beef ounce dry shes got slow bit crunch treat case smaller dog pomeranian really crunch thing even break biscuit apart come breakable bar two smaller portion bar larger dog wouldnt much work least doubt would ill find bit later intend take treat lady friend house much bigger family dog give tryrealistically newman brand one enjoy supporting good reputation product always good dog treat seem yet another good example
5,Lawry's Spices & Seasonings - Enchilada Sauce,"I started using Lawry's Enchilada Sauce seasonings packets years ago when we lived in CA. When we moved to MN 20 years ago I was able to find it in stores here but in the last couple of years it has been unavailable. I have requested the stores start carring it again, to no avail. I was so excited to learn I could order it through Amazon and did. One hint, I sift out all the dried onion flakes before I add the remaining spices to the tomato paste. I prefer to sprinkle fresh green onion over the homemade cheese covered Enchiladas or Chili Rellenos along with a couple of dollops of sour cream and 2 or 3 olives.<br /><br />Wonderful!",Positive,started using lawrys enchilada sauce seasoning packet year ago lived ca moved mn year ago able find store last couple year unavailable requested store start carring avail excited learn could order amazon one hint sift dried onion flake add remaining spice tomato paste prefer sprinkle fresh green onion homemade cheese covered enchilada chili rellenos along couple dollop sour cream oliveswonderful

I am a huge fan of the Trident Splash gum, but the only flavor sold in stores in my area is the Strawberry with Lime, so it's nice to have a different flavor.

5,Rich aroma evokes a confectionery; light roast is delicious,"Be prepared for visitors. The decadent aroma of Chocolate Raspberry Truffle imbues your kitchen (or office) as you brew this light roast from Van Houtte. We brewed a couple cups at the office (in a cubicle) and the rich aroma carried through the office air vents, attracting droopy-eyed co-workers in search of chocolate.<br /><br />Delicate for a flavored coffee, this blend made a delicious afternoon treat. And, amazingly, the artificial flavoring doesn't leave a strong chemical aftertaste. The smell of rich chocolate and raspberries lingers after the last sip, giving the impression that a team of chocolatiers just departed. Honestly, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039556K2"">Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle</a> is heady stuff.<br /><br />We tested and enjoyed Van Houtte Chocolate Raspberry Truffle both on Keurig's small cup (5.25 oz) and small mug (7.25 oz) settings. According to the Van Houtte website, ""The 8-oz size makes the ideal cup of coffee, but you can vary the cup size if you want to change the coffee's strength (for example, choose a larger cup size to get a less intense cup of coffee).""<br /><br />If you are concerned about freshness, our box of 24K cups came with an expiration date of July 10, 2011, or more than six months from our purchase date.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars.",Positive,prepared visitor decadent aroma chocolate raspberry truffle imbues kitchen office brew light roast van houtte brewed couple cup office cubicle rich aroma carried office air vent attracting droopyeyed coworkers search chocolatedelicate flavored coffee blend made delicious afternoon treat amazingly artificial flavoring doesnt leave strong chemical aftertaste smell rich chocolate raspberry lingers last sip giving impression team chocolatiers departed honestly van houtte chocolate raspberry truffle heady stuffwe tested enjoyed van houtte chocolate raspberry truffle keurigs small cup oz small mug oz setting according van houtte website oz size make ideal cup coffee vary cup size want change coffee strength example choose larger cup size get less intense cup coffeeif concerned freshness box k cup came expiration date july six month purchase daterating five star
4,My dog loves these,"These are great treats to use with the large blue disk like things.  The disc like things are good for hiding food and then my miniature schnauzer has to work to get them out.  If I put one of these treats on top she is trying to eat this thing for hours then can't even get it all, so it lasts for a few days before I have to take the treat out so she can finish it.  But I would definitely recommend this with the large blue disk like things as a toy that keeps a dog occupied for a pretty long time.",Positive,great treat use large blue disk like thing disc like thing good hiding food miniature schnauzer work get put one treat top trying eat thing hour cant even get last day take treat finish would definitely recommend large blue disk like thing toy keep dog occupied pretty long time
5,Real food,"We've been experimenting with various oatmeals and this one, hands down, is the best we've found.  It's nutty, chewy and tastes good.  I don't even add salt.<br /><br />One caveat is to let it cook for longer than the package calls for, and add a bit more water.  After 20 minutes, it's still pretty soupy, but 30 minutes gives the perfect texture. For two servings, I use 1/2 cup oats to 1 1/2 cups of water, bring to a boil, cover, reduce the heat and cook for 30 minutes.  I usually add one T of brown sugar and a handful of dried blueberries, dried cranberries or raisins to the water before cooking.  The moisture plumps the dried fruit beautifully and the sugar adds just a hint of sweetness. Slosh on some low fat milk and it's good to go.  This is the perfect breakfast food!",Positive,weve experimenting various oatmeal one hand best weve found nutty chewy taste good dont even add saltone caveat let cook longer package call add bit water minute still pretty soupy minute give perfect texture two serving use cup oat cup water bring boil cover reduce heat cook minute usually add one brown sugar handful dried blueberry dried cranberry raisin water cooking moisture plump dried fruit beautifully sugar add hint sweetness slosh low fat milk good go perfect breakfast food

It takes awhile to squeeze all the milk through (6-8 minutes), but it is worth it when it is done! The only thing is there is no instruction sheet that comes with the bag - or at least to my knowledge (maybe I unknowingly tossed it?).

3,"I love Popchips, but I don't love this flavor","As I write this review, I'm looking at 3 large boxes of Popchips stacked in my living room.  I bought 2 of the 3 boxes, which each contain 24 bags of the chips.  One of the boxes I ordered is Popchips barbeque flavor, the other is the Popchips Variety Pack and now I have a box of the new Chili Lime Popchips that was provided by the manufacturer for this review.<br /><br />I am a big fan of Popchips and I've bought them many times.  Generally, Popchips are low in calories, low in fat and relatively low in sodium.  They make an excellent snack that's a lot better for you than regular potato chips.<br /><br />Problem is, the chili lime flavor really isn't very good, in my view.  There's sort of an off-putting aftertaste to them that I can't just put my finger on.  You can taste the lime, although it's a bit stronger than I'd like, and it sort of tastes like bad chili, but I'm not a fan of this variety.<br /><br />Sure, I'll eventually finish the box, but I wouldn't order them again.  So while I love Popchips in general and enthusiastically recommend them, I can't recommend these and give them a 2.5 star rating, which I'll round up to 3 stars mostly because I do like and support Popchips.<br /><br />I'd recommend avoiding these.  The flavor isn't quite right, in my view.  My favorite flavor is barbecue followed by plain and the variety pack is a good way to figure out what you like the best.  But I cannot recommend Chili Lime Popchips.",Neutral,write review im looking large box popchips stacked living room bought box contain bag chip one box ordered popchips barbeque flavor popchips variety pack box new chili lime popchips provided manufacturer reviewi big fan popchips ive bought many time generally popchips low calorie low fat relatively low sodium make excellent snack thats lot better regular potato chipsproblem chili lime flavor really isnt good view there sort offputting aftertaste cant put finger taste lime although bit stronger id like sort taste like bad chili im fan varietysure ill eventually finish box wouldnt order love popchips general enthusiastically recommend cant recommend give star rating ill round star mostly like support popchipsid recommend avoiding flavor isnt quite right view favorite flavor barbecue followed plain variety pack good way figure like best recommend chili lime popchips

The spices are pretty mild and lacked kick.  It was a generic southwest flavor.  It was hard to distinguish the avacado.  After the reviews, I was expecting better.

Besides its easy brewing steps, the packaging, in my opinion, is what also sets it apart from many green tea products on the market, including many popular brands.<br /><br />The bag is sealed without any staples unlike many tea bags I've tried, and who knows what a staple could do to affect the overall flavor in hot water?

So this tea tasted to me like regular black tea with a very, very strong bergamot-like flavor. I definitely did not care for it, although I love Earl Grey teas in general. On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""a more aromatic version of the Earl's traditional black tea scented with the essence of bergamot""; therein lies the problem---a little too perfumy and scented for me. On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Passion as ""floral, lavender, fragrant, spicy, lemon"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""citrus, lavender, light smoke"".  You may like it; apparently the other reviewers so far do, but it is not for me at all.<br /><br />Also, be careful of letting this tea brew too long accidently. Even a few minutes too long results in a bitter, bitter tea, reminiscent of orange pekoe with a strong perfume added. What a letdown! Even properly brewed, though, this tea cannot, in my opinion, warrant more than three stars.<br /><br />The ingredients in Earl Grey are just black teas and bergamot essence. Note that Earl Grey does contain caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />***",Neutral,tazos earl grey black tea perfumy used drinking superpremium tea real bergamot added essence tea tasted like regular black tea strong bergamotlike flavor definitely care although love earl grey tea general paper tea packet tazo writes aromatic version earl traditional black tea scented essence bergamot therein lie problema little perfumy scented web site tazo describes flavor profile passion floral lavender fragrant spicy lemon tazo describes aroma citrus lavender light smoke may like apparently reviewer far allalso careful letting tea brew long accidently even minute long result bitter bitter tea reminiscent orange pekoe strong perfume added letdown even properly brewed though tea opinion warrant three starsthe ingredient earl grey black tea bergamot essence note earl grey contain caffeinetazo interesting company make super premium tea socially responsible based portland motto reincarnation tea tazo owned starbucks web site fun quirky zentype focus definitely worth checking unclear though web site many ingredient organic kosher use natural flavor teasthis wording seems little vague super premium tea

4,Good on hamburgers and fries,"I'm not a great cook, so we wind up eating a lot of burgers and fries in our house. Instead of picking up fast food, I prepare frozen burger patties and fries in the oven. I tried some of this Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce tonight on the burgers and as a dip for the fries instead of the usual ketchup and mustard. It really woke up the taste and made a normally boring meal a little bit special.<br /><br />I don't know which particular thickening agents are responsible for mouth-feel in a dressing, but I tend to dislike whatever Kraft uses in their salad dressings and sauces; they tend to feel almost slimey or gummy (for lack of a better word) on my tongue with a decidedly ""plastic"" (i.e., overly processed/fake-food) taste. (And forget the low-fat versions of anything; I'd rather do without than have to taste those!) I prefer the taste and mouth-feel of Ken's salad dressings (especially the 0-carb Creamy Caesar), so if you are familiar with both of these products, maybe the following will make sense to you:<br /><br />The Taco Bell Jalapeno Sauce is a lot closer to the mouth-feel of Ken's than to Kraft, but it still has something in it with a bit of that gummy feel to it. It's not nearly as ""plastic""-tasting, though, and it's quite tasty on hamburgers I think. It's not scorching hot, but it's got a bit of a kick to it. It pairs well with a slice of raw onion. I actually like it better thinned with a little Duke's mayonnaise, but only because that cuts down even more on the slight gumminess.<br /><br />I expect we'll buy more.",Positive,im great cook wind eating lot burger fry house instead picking fast food prepare frozen burger patty fry oven tried taco bell jalapeno sauce tonight burger dip fry instead usual ketchup mustard really woke taste made normally boring meal little bit speciali dont know particular thickening agent responsible mouthfeel dressing tend dislike whatever kraft us salad dressing sauce tend feel almost slimey gummy lack better word tongue decidedly plastic ie overly processedfakefood taste forget lowfat version anything id rather without taste prefer taste mouthfeel ken salad dressing especially carb creamy caesar familiar product maybe following make sense youthe taco bell jalapeno sauce lot closer mouthfeel ken kraft still something bit gummy feel nearly plastictasting though quite tasty hamburger think scorching hot got bit kick pair well slice raw onion actually like better thinned little duke mayonnaise cut even slight gumminessi expect well buy
5,"Spicy, Flavorful, and Delicious!!","If you find some of the Kitchens of India recipes a little bland, this one is the opposite: very strong flavors deliciously blend to create a wonderful meal.  This one takes a little longer to make due to the need to marinate the meet for 20 minutes, and also because the recipe calls for 1/3 cup lemon curd (I had to Google this but found it easy to make from a few common ingredients). So while not exactly a ""heat and serve"" recipe, it is still easy and very delicious if you like Indian spices.  My wife and I both loved the strong flavors in the dish, but my wife found it a little bit on the spicy-hot side, while for me ""nothing is too hot"", and this dish was just moderately spicy.  I was tempted to substitute yogurt for the lemon curd, but was really glad I made the lemon curd like the recipe said, because I could taste the hint of lemon in the final product, and it was a really nice touch.  I highly recommend this meal if you like strong flavored spice, and enjoy moderately spicy-hot foods.",Positive,find kitchen india recipe little bland one opposite strong flavor deliciously blend create wonderful meal one take little longer make due need marinate meet minute also recipe call cup lemon curd google found easy make common ingredient exactly heat serve recipe still easy delicious like indian spice wife loved strong flavor dish wife found little bit spicyhot side nothing hot dish moderately spicy tempted substitute yogurt lemon curd really glad made lemon curd like recipe said could taste hint lemon final product really nice touch highly recommend meal like strong flavored spice enjoy moderately spicyhot food

4,Great for Smoothies,"I was looking for an alternative source of protein because I try to avoid soy as much as possible.  I read about hemp and wanted to give it a try.  I bought a couple different kinds but didn't like that some of them -- mostly the ones with flavor -- have a bunch of stuff added to them.  Plus they didn't taste good.  I started adding two scoops of Living Harvest Hemp Protein Powder to my smoothies, along with almond milk or kefir and berries.  The hemp powder made the smoothie an awful color but I thought the berries covered the ""dirty"" taste of the powder.  I can't imagine adding it to water or food -- I don't think I could get it down.  But if you're looking for something to add to smoothies, give this a try.",Positive,looking alternative source protein try avoid soy much possible read hemp wanted give try bought couple different kind didnt like mostly one flavor bunch stuff added plus didnt taste good started adding two scoop living harvest hemp protein powder smoothy along almond milk kefir berry hemp powder made smoothie awful color thought berry covered dirty taste powder cant imagine adding water food dont think could get youre looking something add smoothy give try

5,Great Wet Food for Indoor Cats - Worth the Money,"When you buy Natural Balance (Dick Van Patten's Brand from ""Eight is Enough"" -- who knew) you will discover that you are paying more than your regular Friskies, 9-Lives or regular store available brands.  In fact, sometimes this brand is hard to find ... but it's worth every penny.<br /><br />Our cats enjoy a mixture of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008VKBEQ"">Wellness Healthy Weight Formula Dry Cat Food</a> and Natural Balance wet food.  I use the Indoor formula because they are indoor cats.  Our cats love this formula and chow it down like happy campers.  Their fur is soft as can be, their eyes are bright and they are in great health.<br /><br />You need to understand that in the world of cat food like so many other things, you really get what you pay for.  You will either spend more money on food, or eventually more money on litter materials because feeding a cat regular store bought food with a lot of ""corn meal"" filler creates the smelliest, and fullest litter box around.  Time has taught me this.<br /><br />Once you begin to understand that all cat foods are not created equal and where there is ""corn meal"" filler in the ingredient list (cheap for manufacturers and smelly for the household), you will have more cat waste and more litter to have to scoop and buy.<br /><br />With good foods like Natural Balance (if your cat tolerates it well), you will discover less cat ""poop"" in the litter box and a LOT less smell around the house.  Put good stuff in your cat, get more pleasant outcomes :)<br /><br />I've lived it and learned it.  We are a 5 cat household with ONE litterbox and do amazingly fine.  I use <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EUIP9Y"">Nature's Logic Ponderosa Pine Cat Litter</a> and this keeps odors to an absolute minumum.  Some people wonder if we have cats!

Bummer, cause I really liked the first batch and will now be hesitant to risk another purchase.  BTW, I have purchased several Tao of Tea oolongs through amazon and this was the only one worth purchasing.

4,Chocolate + almonds = A match made in heaven!,"Let me just out myself from the get-go here--I am a HUGE chocoholic.  I am also an almond lover and eat a small handful of dry roasted, unsalted almonds nearly every day.  So, when I saw dark chocolate cocoa-roasted almonds offered on amazon, it seemed a match made in heaven. :)<br /><br />What surprised me most, I think, about these delicious cocoa-roasted almonds is that they are not over sweet (only 1 gram of sugar per 1/4 cup serving).  I worried that they would taste like candy and that is not something I need more of (I am already slave enough to the Sweet Monster!).<br /><br />Another pleasant surprise was that the almonds are not salty.  I have hypertension and need to limit my salt so, when the almonds arrived and I reviewed the nutrition label, I was pleased to see that they only have 25 mg of sodium per 1/4 cup serving and that they are made with dry-roasted vs. oil-roasted almonds.<br /><br />In my chocoholic fervor while ordering, I hadn't paid attention to what size cannister the almonds would come in, so I was again pleasantly surprised to find that they came in a generous 11 oz. cannister.<br /><br />I had some friends over last weekend and put out a dish of the almonds on the table.

4,"Fairly strong vanilla scent, not as much vanilla taste","I had high hopes for this coffee.  I sometimes enjoy having a flavored coffee, but I don't generally like the sweetness that comes with the syrups.<br /><br />When I brewed it, it had a very strong, natural vanilla smell, which I really liked.  It made my kitchen smell warm and inviting!<br /><br />The taste, however, is much more subtle.  Perhaps this is because the coffee is strong, and vanilla is a delicate flavor.  I found that most of the vanilla was really coming in through the aroma.<br /><br />So, if you are looking for something that tastes like coffee with syrup in it, this definitely isn't it. However, I think it would get a bit overpowering for my taste if it did, so I'm fine with that.  Just understand what you are getting.<br /><br />Sean P.

1,Not So Everlasting,"I bought two of these treat balls for two large breed dogs.  One, (my power chewer) is a German Shepherd/Wolf mix, the other is a Vizsla/lab mix who isn't easily impressed by chew toys.  I filled the inside of the ball with small treats, and capped both ends with the round treats provided.  On the upside when they were actively chewing on the treat balls, they were fully absorbed, and were extremely happy with them.  In about an hour and a half both dogs had chewed the everlasting out of at least one side of each of their treat balls.  By three hours there were no treats left in either of them.  Since the ball itself seems pretty flimsy I then took the balls away so they wouldn't destroy those too.

4,Very Easy To Use,I didn't buy Perfect Pod to save money.  I bought it so I could use my favorite brands of coffee with my pod coffee maker.  Perfect Pod allows me to do that and it is very easy to use.  I prefer it to a permanent filter basket because there's no mess to clean up after each cup of coffee.  The only thing that would make Perfect Pod better is if they included a coffee scoop sized just for the pods it makes.,Positive,didnt buy perfect pod save money bought could use favorite brand coffee pod coffee maker perfect pod allows easy use prefer permanent filter basket there mess clean cup coffee thing would make perfect pod better included coffee scoop sized pod make

4,Basic Orange Herb Tea,"****<br /><br />Tazo's Wild Sweet Orange Herbal Infusion is a nice orange herbal tea. It contains lemongrass, blackberry leaves, citric acid, rose hips, spearmint leaves, natural flavors, orange peel, safflowers, hibiscus flowers, rose petals, natural orange essence, ginger root and licorice root. It is not sweet, very fruity, and not subtle at all, a wonderful tea if you enjoy orangey teas.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, ""The Reincarnation of Tea"". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some ""natural flavors"" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, ""a lively blend of sweet citrus herbs and orange essences. Sweet, yet tart, this is a cup of liquid sunshine, radiating multi-layered orange flavors with exotic hints of spice and a distinctive floral finish. Wild, indeed."" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Wild Sweet Orange as ""tart, sweet, smooth, licorice"". Tazo describes the aroma as ""oranges, roses, lime"".  This is pretty accurate, although the words give hope that the taste of the tea never quite approaches.<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings---but not as good as Numi. I'm soooooo spoiled by Numi teas, which is why Tazo Wild Sweet Orange gets only four stars.<br /><br />****",Positive,tazos wild sweet orange herbal infusion nice orange herbal tea contains lemongrass blackberry leaf citric acid rose hip spearmint leaf natural flavor orange peel safflower hibiscus flower rose petal natural orange essence ginger root licorice root sweet fruity subtle wonderful tea enjoy orangey teastazo interesting company make super premium tea socially responsible based portland motto reincarnation tea tazo owned starbucks web site fun quirky zentype focus definitely worth checking unclear though web site many ingredient organic kosher use natural flavor teasthis wording seems little vague super premium teaon paper tea packet tazo writes lively blend sweet citrus herb orange essence sweet yet tart cup liquid sunshine radiating multilayered orange flavor exotic hint spice distinctive floral finish wild indeed web site tazo describes flavor profile wild sweet orange tart sweet smooth licorice tazo describes aroma orange rose lime pretty accurate although word give hope taste tea never quite approachesi would rate tea tazo general goodbetter premium tea like stash celestial seasoningsbut good numi im soooooo spoiled numi tea tazo wild sweet orange get four star

First 3 of my rocks are a bright turquoise color not a brown, gray or earthy color.  I also only got 11 rocks.  Stating only the ounces on this listing is ridiculous when the picture looks like ""pebbles""  I knew I was only getting a couple of ounces but at the pebble size it would have been enough for my project.

1,Beans were crushed and mushy,"I opened 4 of the 12 cans in this case and in each of them, less than 10 beans per can were edible.  Most of them were crushed, smashed or broken in some way, making them inedible (they would taste like ""can"").

3,Too much perfume for me... cleans well though.,"Not too much to add to the title. 3-stars cuz it works, no more cuz it's too smelly for my use. This seems like a product in search of a niche.

When I saw this as a choice on Vine, I thought, ""What the heck? Give it a try. You can always clean off the scum.""<br /><br />This product cleans well and leaves a slippery feeling to the skin (we have softened water) when rinsed off, but it leaves a very obvious aftershave-like smell: it actually work me up several times during the night the one-time I used it to shower with. So, no more showers with this for me! However, I am using it during the day to wash the old armpits. It really does clean and de-smellify well.<br /><br />Added after reading the previous reviews: there is a ""technical problem"" with the container.

An easy way to get potassium was what I was looking for, but when I took my first sip I was hooked!  Not only is this loaded with the potassium I needed for my nightly leg cramps, it has a mild, pleasant flavor. Talk about refreshing; I can't wait for summer now!  There is an instant cooling sensation, a pleasant, smooth mouth-feel, and a thirst quenching ability you wish a soda had.  I've tried other brands, but they come across as ""raw"" or harsh; for me O.N.E. is the V.S.O.P. of coconut waters (to me, that means the best).

He said it obviously upset his digestive tract. He was throwing up bits of it over 24 hrs after having just one.  The vet said my dog is VERY HEALTHY except for this.  He is a little over a year old and in great shape...until he had one of these.  AND FOR THE RECORD....My dog HAS HAD RAWHIDE chew sticks before with NO ill effects.

It isn't my favorite flavor as I am not a fan of Redbull, but if you do then this syrup just may be for you.<br /><br />*EDIT* I just realized when I wrote that it does not taste like a Sprite the person was commenting about the Lemon Lime syrup.

4,"Tasty, filling, but only four servings per box.","I am not on a gluten free diet. However, I find gluten free foods more filling. And so, I gave these crackers a try, after coming across them in my grocery store. I like the original and cheddar flavours the best (the cheddar flavour is very delicate).<br /><br />1) I have not experienced the breakage problem some mention. Yes, there is a broken cracker here and there, but nothing out of norm. Quite frankly, I think they pack them as they do, in two pouches, two servings each, in order to pump up the volume, so to speak. Each of these boxes contains only four servings (32 crackers). That's not much for the price. This is the only reason for the four, rather then five star rating.<br />2) They are filling and tasty. I am addicted to these crackers with red pepper humus. Yum! They scoop well once you get a hang of it (they are flaky and will break more often then regular crackers would in the same situation).<br />3) The box is made of 100% recycled material, for those to whom this matters.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />PS: There is a warning on the label that says they may contain traces of soy, milk, and sesame, in case anyone is alergic.

5,Gotta love the sugar free cider,I was alittle worried when I bought this that it being sugar free would mean a funny after taste.  Boy was I wrong.  I love this stuff!  It is warm and sweet and the hint of caramel is something really special.  I keep it as a special treat for those cool nights.

3,If you are hungering for some Taco Bell - this is the sauce for you!,"Interestingly, even when comparing with other sauces, this immediately brought to mind Taco Bell.  I never realized their sauces were so distinctive.<br /><br />With regard to the sauce itself, the consistency is thick, tasting like a mayonnaise base with some BBQ Sauce added and then mixed with some chipotle (minus the seeds). Mildly warm, extremely creamy... certainly not bad... more like comfort food - what you would grab in the middle of the night, not what you would feed to honored guests.<br /><br />So... it fills the bill for standard fare, but would be just as easy to make your own and cut down some of the fat and salt (of which this sauce has a ton of both!!!) and pick up some extra flavor and ""freshness"". Hope this review is helpful.<br /><br />All the best,<br /><br />Jay",Neutral,interestingly even comparing sauce immediately brought mind taco bell never realized sauce distinctivewith regard sauce consistency thick tasting like mayonnaise base bbq sauce added mixed chipotle minus seed mildly warm extremely creamy certainly bad like comfort food would grab middle night would feed honored guestsso fill bill standard fare would easy make cut fat salt sauce ton pick extra flavor freshness hope review helpfulall bestjay

It was a Kirkland-Campbell Tomato Bisque and I would buy it by the dozens. Unfortunately, I can't find it there any more. Checked two stores already, none to be found.

3,Not So Peachy,"Probably the best thing about MIO is its portability and sharability. The problem is that the flavor  may not be outstanding enough for anyone to want to share.<br /><br />I don't particularly care for the phony label ""Water Enhancer"". Adding an artificial color, artificial sweetener, and an unnatural taste that only approximates the flavor created in nature does not seem like an enhancement to me.<br /><br />The MIO is easy to use - flip open the cap, squeeze some MIO into the water for an explosion of color, taste, squeeze again, taste, squeeze again if necessary, continue squeezing and tasting until satisfied, and then clip the lid shut.<br /><br />The inexact nature of the squeeze is a sticking point for me because it's almost impossible to duplicate the exact amount squeezed each time. One could measure half a teaspoon of liquid first but that defeats the design of the product.<br /><br /> I've only tried the Mango/Peach. It has great color but only average taste that tastes slightly artificial. There is a chalky aftertaste after each swallow, but not an obtrusive one.  I much prefer Crystal Light for taste though I also find it tedious to mix just the right amount of product into the water with the CL.<br /><br />Anyone so inclined might find it easy to shoplift such a small handful of a container, but the taste of the product might preclude such shenanigans.",Neutral,probably best thing mio portability sharability problem flavor may outstanding enough anyone want sharei dont particularly care phony label water enhancer adding artificial color artificial sweetener unnatural taste approximates flavor created nature seem like enhancement methe mio easy use flip open cap squeeze mio water explosion color taste squeeze taste squeeze necessary continue squeezing tasting satisfied clip lid shutthe inexact nature squeeze sticking point almost impossible duplicate exact amount squeezed time one could measure half teaspoon liquid first defeat design product ive tried mangopeach great color average taste taste slightly artificial chalky aftertaste swallow obtrusive one much prefer crystal light taste though also find tedious mix right amount product water clanyone inclined might find easy shoplift small handful container taste product might preclude shenanigan

3,it is cheap caviar,"let's face it not spending a lot on this caviar. It's going to taste like that. I would not recommend eating this caviar from the jar. It's not that kind of caviar. It is a little fishy, maybe more than other caviar's, but it's actually not a bad product altogether. I would recommend serving or using this caviar with things such as sour cream, hard-boiled eggs or some nicely selected crackers. I have even found a pretty good recipe for a tasty little appetizer using this type of caviar.

1,Kitty Junk Food,"We have five cats - one an elderly cat of 15 years, the other four in the 9-11 year range.  The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck.",Negative,five cat one elderly cat year four year range oldest cat diagnosed couple month ago beginning stage chronic kidney disease number didnt warrant prescription food yet needed start paying attention thing like protein phosphorus level food five cat nibbler eating four five nugget time decided switch acceptable food oldest picked active longevity specifically mentioned kidney support calorie appropriate less active older catssince made switch week ago cat gained weight fine little old guy bit underweight good rest male went slightly chunky lb obese lb almost three pound week female gained pound noticed making lot visit food bowl like couldnt seem get full also saw lessening coat quality lot shedding even though brushed regularly including furminator one developed bad dandruff stool developed really bad odor although say nobody developed diarrhea grateful worrisome lab result old guy came back kidney value concern worsenedi disgusted science diet actively fooling public nutritional claim bag one site researched chronic renal failure chart detailing nutritional breakdown various food available compare various science diet formula different health claim nutritional value component listed within tenth point two basically nutritional analysis appears base formula maybe slight difference vitamin additive brand innova royal canin appears actual difference different formulaenow deal weight gain well problem noted switching food time trying royal canin indoor mature wish u luck
5,I love this Quinoa. Cooks up well in a rice cooker.,"This has quickly become a staple in our home! It has a pleasant nutty taste that is nice plain or seasoned and works well with a lot of other foods. It doesn't need to be rinsed and cooks up easily in the rice cooker.<br /><br />I love that I can get it started with one hand in less than a minute with a baby on my hip! One time when I made it, I measured out the whole package with my rice cooker cup (3.5 rice cooker cups) and added twice as much water (7 rice cooker cups). I took note of the water level in the rice cooker bowl (right at my ""Sweet 6"" line). So now I can just dump the pouch in the bowl, fill with water up to the Sweet 6 line, set it to the brown rice setting, and start. That's it! My rice cooker brown rice setting takes 1 hr 45 minutes. I start it early in the day and the rice cooker keeps it warm until I'm ready for it. It always comes out light and fluffy. I have not tried it with the quick rice setting or on the stove-top, so I'm honestly not sure if there is any difference in taste or texture between the methods.<br /><br />I make an entire package once or twice a week. My family of 5 eats about 1/3 of it the first night and we finish it as leftovers over the next few days. One of my favorite ways to serve it is as quinoa salad, which I make with cold (leftover) quinoa, tomato, cucumber, maybe some onions, avocado and/or bell peppers, feta and some red wine vinaigrette. The texture of the quinoa goes well with the salad, and it soaks up the vinaigrette and takes on the taste. It is really a delight.<br /><br />The price with Subscribe & Save is great, especially considering that it is organic and fair trade, and doesn't need to be rinsed.",Positive,quickly become staple home pleasant nutty taste nice plain seasoned work well lot food doesnt need rinsed cook easily rice cookeri love get started one hand less minute baby hip one time made measured whole package rice cooker cup rice cooker cup added twice much water rice cooker cup took note water level rice cooker bowl right sweet line dump pouch bowl fill water sweet line set brown rice setting start thats rice cooker brown rice setting take hr minute start early day rice cooker keep warm im ready always come light fluffy tried quick rice setting stovetop im honestly sure difference taste texture methodsi make entire package twice week family eats first night finish leftover next day one favorite way serve quinoa salad make cold leftover quinoa tomato cucumber maybe onion avocado andor bell pepper feta red wine vinaigrette texture quinoa go well salad soak vinaigrette take taste really delightthe price subscribe save great especially considering organic fair trade doesnt need rinsed

4,"Good toasted with melted cheese, but EXP date might be too soon","OK, so it isn't exactly as good as grilled cheese, but melting a slice of cheese on one of these crispy discs in the microwave is close enough for me, plus no need for fattening butter. The ""thins"" are about a quarter-inch thick (maybe a little less), not too thick and not too thin.  They offer a multitude of options for quick GF meals, perfect for someone like me who typically eats several 1-course small meals throughout the day vs. 3 large multi-course ones.  The taste is very mild, relying on whatever you put on them to add 95% of the flavor.  By the way, they are called Corn Thins, but technically they are made out of ""popped corn""; so they are a little puffy, sort of like rice cakes but thinner and crispier.<br />My batch just arrived with an expiration date of October 2010, which is a tight time frame but because these are so versatile, I think I can manage finishing them by then.<br /><br />UPDATE (Feb. 2010) The last two unfinished packages were stale by the end of August.  In spite of the inner foil liners, they didn't make it to the specified EXP date and I ended up throwing those two away.  Because the bulk quantity is so high (6 would make more sense) I'm afraid I won't be buying this again; I just can't finish them in time.",Positive,ok isnt exactly good grilled cheese melting slice cheese one crispy disc microwave close enough plus need fattening butter thins quarterinch thick maybe little less thick thin offer multitude option quick gf meal perfect someone like typically eats several course small meal throughout day v large multicourse one taste mild relying whatever put add flavor way called corn thins technically made popped corn little puffy sort like rice cake thinner crispiermy batch arrived expiration date october tight time frame versatile think manage finishing thenupdate feb last two unfinished package stale end august spite inner foil liner didnt make specified exp date ended throwing two away bulk quantity high would make sense im afraid wont buying cant finish time

5,Best K-Cup for Strong Coffee Drinkers Yet,"I've had my Keurig for a year, and my only complaint has been the quality of the coffee made:  Not bad, but not nearly strong enough for people who think their coffee should run like molten lava rather than a fast trickling stream (OK, not really sludge, but you get what I mean).  The closest I came to finding a good cup was Dunkin Donuts' Dunkin Dark, but they are pretty expensive from the store.<br /><br />After reading the reviews here, I decided to give Jet Fuel a try.  WHOA!  This is proper coffee that will put hair on your chest, but also tastes DELICIOUS.  Buying in packs of 50 for a family with 3 coffee drinkers (and frequent visitors) also means fewer trips to the store for coffee.<br /><br />Very happy I chose to buy this brand, and now enjoy my morning hassle-free cup of coffee!",Positive,ive keurig year complaint quality coffee made bad nearly strong enough people think coffee run like molten lava rather fast trickling stream ok really sludge get mean closest came finding good cup dunkin donut dunkin dark pretty expensive storeafter reading review decided give jet fuel try whoa proper coffee put hair chest also taste delicious buying pack family coffee drinker frequent visitor also mean fewer trip store coffeevery happy chose buy brand enjoy morning hasslefree cup coffee

I actually prefer the low cal stuff, and its a staple in my fridge.<br /><br />I should also mention that Red Bull can only truly be appreciated if you've had other 'lesser' energy drinks (rock star comes to mind).

This has much less sugar than regular soda and is organic.  But, did you know it is made by PEPSI??  I didn't until I wrote to the company online to tell them about the metal taste and received an email back from PEPSI. It is a tad deceiving for the IZZE company to claim to be its own entity when it is owned and operated by PEPSI.

4,Y U M M Y......R I C E....!,"The ONLY reason I give ZATARAIN'S NEW ORLEANS STYLE JAMBALAYA MIX, 8-OUNCE BOXES, (PACK OF 12), four stars instead of 5 is because one must buy 12 boxes together, here on Amazon.  It's scrumptious rice, but I must agree with another reviewer who said his family got tired of it after ""only"" 3 boxes, and the rest is now sitting on the shelf. Too much of anything -- even something as delicious as this rice -- does get tiring after a while.  Of oourse there are all kinds of customers who buy from Amazon -- some people are lucky enough to have friends, family or neighbours to share the large quantities, and prices, that Amazon puts into it's quantity packages.<br />But others, like myself, have only two -- or only one-- person for whom to buy food.  Thus, I think that BOTH large quantity packaging, (12), and small quantity packaging, (4?), should be made available.<br /><br />As for the product itself, it is truly superb!  It has just the right amount of spice, and just the right kind of spice.  It will not burn your taste-buds as some overly-spicy rice does...nor will it bore your taste-buds, as too-plain rice does.

4,Doesn't last long for agressive chewers,I don't like all the controversy surrounding rawhide bones and don't want take the risk of my Lab getting a blockage so I exclusively give him Booda bones which are safe. My lab is an aggressive chewer and considering this is edible it makes him that much more excited as he LOVES food. He enjoys these bones but devours them in less than 20 minutes. I usually give it to him for a few minutes until he eats half of it and then I take it away to save for next time.

2,Very mellow...almost flavorless,"Maybe if I used two pods, I might get the desired flavor out of a small cup of coffee?  I don't know.  I didn't taste any chocolate or buttercruch...or even coffee for that matter.  To the contrary, all I could taste out of one of these pods was the half pouch of Splenda I used to sweeten it.  Maybe I got an old pod, but I think it's pretty fair to say that I won't be buying these separately.  They are marginally better than the ones you can buy directly from Senseo.",Negative,maybe used two pod might get desired flavor small cup coffee dont know didnt taste chocolate buttercruchor even coffee matter contrary could taste one pod half pouch splenda used sweeten maybe got old pod think pretty fair say wont buying separately marginally better one buy directly senseo
5,This is truly fantastic!,"I love this sauce.  This sauce is made to showcase Guajillo peppers, and it does so very well.  If you are not familiar with Guajillo's, they are similar to Ancho's but with a more chocolatey flavor.<br /><br />It is my favorite in the Bufalo line, and is the original sauce that started it all for that company.  Very highly recommended.",Positive,love sauce sauce made showcase guajillo pepper well familiar guajillos similar anchos chocolatey flavorit favorite bufalo line original sauce started company highly recommended

5,Highly recommended.,"I am so glad I tried this premium dog food at a great price for a small (but not too small) bag to try it. My dog loves it and I feel better about giving her something healthy. Next I will try the canned food. I do wish these companies would offer 6 can deals however instead of just 12 and 24 can deals for ""taste-testing"". Not every dog likes a drastic change from junk foods to higher quality food.

5,"Good quality with a quaint, natural taste","I've been eating these chips with my lunch every day for over two years now. I love the taste first of all. Unlike two other black bean corn chip products I have tried (and more and more chip makers seem to be making black bean corn chips now), these are what they say they are: corn chips with black beans in them - - no lime or herb or any other kind of ""flavor enhancer"".<br /><br />I like the price of the chips here on Amazon. A 7.5 ounce bag sells for around $3 a bag, sometimes less when on sale.  Here, the case price works out to about $2.25 a bag,  - and delivery is free.",Positive,ive eating chip lunch every day two year love taste first unlike two black bean corn chip product tried chip maker seem making black bean corn chip say corn chip black bean lime herb kind flavor enhanceri like price chip amazon ounce bag sell around bag sometimes less sale case price work bag delivery free
5,"Tastes great, less filling, no side effects or aftertaste","I could not use any of the not-to-be-named pre-Splenda sweeteners. I simply could not tolerate their taste AND the aftertaste. I've been a Splenda user ever since it became available - 10 years? - because... well... the taste is VERY close to sugar's own and, as far as I know, there are NO side effects.<br /><br />My understanding of the Splenda technology is that the process starts with what is supposed to be a 'sugar' molecule and then ONE atom is replaced with another which makes it impossible to digest so it simply passes through your digestive tract. You get zero calories, good taste and no side effects.<br /><br />So... what's not to like? The price? That's were the wisdom of buying these large but not too heavy Splenda boxes comes from.<br /><br />I NEVER put anything sweet into my tea or my coffee - a habit I probably developed during those dark, sad, pre-Splenda days - but, when it comes to Cappuccino... it's a different story. I am reaching for the little yellow packets. A box of these lasts me for a long, long time. When it comes to cooking, the Splenda is calibrated to be the equivalent of sugar by volume. In other words, a cup of Splenda is used whenever the recipe calls for a cop of sugar.",Positive,could use nottobenamed presplenda sweetener simply could tolerate taste aftertaste ive splenda user ever since became available year well taste close sugar far know side effectsmy understanding splenda technology process start supposed sugar molecule one atom replaced another make impossible digest simply pass digestive tract get zero calorie good taste side effectsso whats like price thats wisdom buying large heavy splenda box come fromi never put anything sweet tea coffee habit probably developed dark sad presplenda day come cappuccino different story reaching little yellow packet box last long long time come cooking splenda calibrated equivalent sugar volume word cup splenda used whenever recipe call cop sugar
2,All my seven cats refuse to eat this.,"I purchased this cat food after careful research on all the different wet cat food available.  I finally decided this was the best even though it was on the high side of expensive.  I never considered that ALL of my 4 adult cats and 3 kittens would refuse to touch it. Really???  I have never seen them do that before so I thought to try again on another day.  Nope not a fluke-- they steer clear of this food completely.  I will be donating the remaining 22 cans to the SPCA (where I adopted the three kittens from).  Wasted money?  Maybe, but hopefully the cats in the shelter will eat it.",Negative,purchased cat food careful research different wet cat food available finally decided best even though high side expensive never considered adult cat kitten would refuse touch really never seen thought try another day nope fluke steer clear food completely donating remaining can spca adopted three kitten wasted money maybe hopefully cat shelter eat
5,These cookies are great for pups with food allergies and Amazon came thru on replacement policy.,"These cookies are a bit on the expensive side--with that said, THEY ARE GREAT for dogs with food allergies. My pup is allergic to almost everything. He loves these cookies so much and so far they have been good for his internals. I can't praise these cookies enough.<br /><br />This package arrived at my home in bad condition. The outer box was smashed and someone had taped it together. The monzies cookie box was also smashed and the bag inside the cookie box was torn. The cookies were loose inside the box.

5,The only protein drink II make sure I don't run out of!,"I LOVE my CLICK in the morning... I buy both and I have both on subscription orders through Amazon --I can't run out!  My day just doesn't start out right unless I ""click"" first!  I have been drinking the Mocha flavor for the past year and couldn't wait for the vanilla to be released, I just knew I was going to love it.  I was right, it's yummy! I love it more than the mocha flavor, it seems smoother and it doesn't have as strong of coffee taste to it either.  I love the smell of the vanilla when you open the canister, but thankfully it does NOT have an overpowering sweet vanilla taste to it.  I actually prefer my Click Vanilla Latte to the ""[...]"" v. latte--it's great.  I am so thankful for both Click products, it helps me get my daily protein requirements each day, it has helped me reach my weight loss goals, and it gives me a little kick of energy in the afternoons when I need it and I don't know what I would do without it to start my mornings.  Do yourself a favor and Click!<br /><br />p.s. I wish Amazon sold the ""CLICK"" shaker cup --it's my favorite shaker cup too but I don't want to pay the S & H to get another one -that makes it too expensive!

2,bad beef,I'm normally a fan of jack links but this really disappointed me. Ordered 4 bags and had two of them. I spent more time picking through the meat taking out the nasty gizard and fat chunks all throughout the bag. Also the meat quality was terrible and quality control isn't. Good for this flavor. One piece would be moist and flavorful and the next would bard as a rock and uncomfortable to chew. Overall this was a terrible product. Jack links shouldn't put 10 different cuts of meat in the same bag. If you like quality controlled products this isn't for you.,Negative,im normally fan jack link really disappointed ordered bag two spent time picking meat taking nasty gizard fat chunk throughout bag also meat quality terrible quality control isnt good flavor one piece would moist flavorful next would bard rock uncomfortable chew overall terrible product jack link shouldnt put different cut meat bag like quality controlled product isnt

5,"Chewy, sweet, and 1 points plus","I bought these when I was looking for low point snacks as I have been doing Weight Watchers.  I eat the cinnamon apples when I want something crunchy.  When I want chewy and a little sweeter, I eat the dried pears.  While many times I do eat 2 packages for a snack, I still buy the .64 ounce bags since I have to get up and go get a second bag giving myself time to decide if I really still am hungry.  While it is true that some pieces have core and/or seed on them, I find it easy to cut that off or eat around it.  This is a great diet food and I like that it is organic.",Positive,bought looking low point snack weight watcher eat cinnamon apple want something crunchy want chewy little sweeter eat dried pear many time eat package snack still buy ounce bag since get go get second bag giving time decide really still hungry true piece core andor seed find easy cut eat around great diet food like organic
4,Good quality coffee-- cheaper and less waste,"I was given a Keurig as a gift and it is so easy to use that I use it almost exclusively.  I had previously used several favorite brands/types of coffee and I ground them fresh for use with a drip pot.<br /><br />Keurig K-cups do not normally meet my expectations, particularly in the strength of the brew but I have adopted the habit of using K-cups for my morning cup to ""chase the fog away"" and the brands I selected for daily use were good but expensive.  This coffee I found as part of a continuous effort to try new brands, to reduce waste but particularly in light of the increase of the price of my favorite brand to ~$0.71/K-cup.  Since I drink a double 7oz brew for that first cup to get enough volume with the brew size reduced for strength, that works out to nearly $1.50 a cup IN MY OWN KITCHEN for a less than premium brew.  This San Francisco Bay Coffee is of more than acceptable flavor and is very nicely priced @ $0.38/K-cup with an automatic repeating order-- close to half the price of my former choice.<br /><br />Incidentally, after the morning dose, if I want more, I then have enough functioning brain cells to recycle used, washed K-cups using the K-saver stainless steel lids <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004XRTDVS"">Re-use K-Cups K-Savers Stainless Steel Lid 5 Pack, for Use with Keurig Machine</a> and my favorite Vietnamese coffee which costs ~$0.20/K-cup.  This is the best brew and the least wasteful way but I don't have the patience too do it in the early morning until awake.  I recommend it highly.<br /><br />San Fran Bay coffee are very similar to K-cups but they do not have a complete cup attached to the mesh brew bag.  This eliminates a lot of hard plastic waste.",Positive,given keurig gift easy use use almost exclusively previously used several favorite brandstypes coffee ground fresh use drip potkeurig kcups normally meet expectation particularly strength brew adopted habit using kcups morning cup chase fog away brand selected daily use good expensive coffee found part continuous effort try new brand reduce waste particularly light increase price favorite brand kcup since drink double oz brew first cup get enough volume brew size reduced strength work nearly cup kitchen less premium brew san francisco bay coffee acceptable flavor nicely priced kcup automatic repeating order close half price former choiceincidentally morning dose want enough functioning brain cell recycle used washed kcups using ksaver stainless steel lid reuse kcups ksavers stainless steel lid pack use keurig machine favorite vietnamese coffee cost kcup best brew least wasteful way dont patience early morning awake recommend highlysan fran bay coffee similar kcups complete cup attached mesh brew bag eliminates lot hard plastic waste
5,Easiest Way to Give Cat a Pill,"This product was recommended to me by my cat's veterinarian.  The product really works with my cat.  It's not obvious when you order, but there are two sizes of pill pockets, and this is the smaller size (size of the pocket, not just quantity).  It works for what I need to give my cat, but may not work for some pills, so I advise buyers to pay attention to this.",Positive,product recommended cat veterinarian product really work cat obvious order two size pill pocket smaller size size pocket quantity work need give cat may work pill advise buyer pay attention

3,"Hard to Dissolve, but Tastes Good","For the No Sugar Added version, this stuff tastes good. You also don't need to use a 1/3 cup like the old CBTL version of this powder, only a few tablespoons. However, no matter how hot your liquid, it is really hard to get it all to dissolve. I have ""whisked"" it and still wound up with clumps at the bottom of the coffee.",Neutral,sugar added version stuff taste good also dont need use cup like old cbtl version powder tablespoon however matter hot liquid really hard get dissolve whisked still wound clump bottom coffee

5,"Good coffee - arabica is the best, nice flavor, convenient","As you can tell from my user name, I'm a bit of a coffee lover and have been for years however, I despise crummy coffee, instant coffee, coffee fillers, artifical flavorings etc...I like rich, dark arabica coffee served strong and black.<br /><br />Typically I grind my own (organic) beans using a vintage mill and french press but there are times when it's not possible to make a decent cup of coffee. This fits the bill perfectly. A nice balance, not weak but not overpowering, solid arabic rather than the inferior robusta and all the convenience. Kosher (important) and relatively free from preservatives etc... I wish there was an organic option but aside from that, I was very impressed by the flavor.",Positive,tell user name im bit coffee lover year however despise crummy coffee instant coffee coffee filler artifical flavoring etci like rich dark arabica coffee served strong blacktypically grind organic bean using vintage mill french press time possible make decent cup coffee fit bill perfectly nice balance weak overpowering solid arabic rather inferior robusta convenience kosher important relatively free preservative etc wish organic option aside impressed flavor

5,Wellness Grain-Free canned cat food,"When my female cat came down w/pancreatitis a few years ago (to the tune of $1000), I started researching what her diet should include.  My vet wanted her on canned food that was low in carbs, but Gracie didn't care for it the prescription brand I was buying at the vet.  Also, I noticed on the can that corn was an ingredient.  I asked her about this, considering corn is a sugary veggie and she also wanted Gracie to lose about 3-4 lbs.  She told me that the main idea was to have her eat a canned food that was 8% or less in carbohydrates IN A DRY STATE.  That means, they take the food, dry it out and get the true percentages of carbs, etc.<br />When I did some research on the web about pancreatitus in cats, I found that GRAIN in cat food can bring on and/or aggravate the condition. I read many articles that explained that cats DON'T NEED grain in their diet.  Pet food manufacturers put it in there because it sounds good to us, the pet owners, when we read that the food contains brown rice, etc.  But what's good for us, as we all know, isn't always good for them.<br /><br />I looked at many companies that made Grain-Free food and was very impressed w/Wellness.  They have many varieties that are grain-free.  When I called them to get the percentage of carbs in a dry matter basis, they were prepared and quick to answer w/out having to transfer me 10 times.<br />The food is not inexpensive, but my cat REALLY likes it.  This bout w/pancreatitis occured about 4 years ago. She has been on Wellness ever since and is in excellent health. She is now 14 yrs old.<br /><br />I highly endorse this product.  If I get another cat someday, I will feed her grain-free food from kittenhood.<br />BTW, they also make grain-free dry food, but I haven't tried it.<br /><br />Good luck!<br />Allie",Positive,female cat came wpancreatitis year ago tune started researching diet include vet wanted canned food low carbs gracie didnt care prescription brand buying vet also noticed corn ingredient asked considering corn sugary veggie also wanted gracie lose lb told main idea eat canned food less carbohydrate dry state mean take food dry get true percentage carbs etcwhen research web pancreatitus cat found grain cat food bring andor aggravate condition read many article explained cat dont need grain diet pet food manufacturer put sound good u pet owner read food contains brown rice etc whats good u know isnt always good themi looked many company made grainfree food impressed wwellness many variety grainfree called get percentage carbs dry matter basis prepared quick answer wout transfer timesthe food inexpensive cat really like bout wpancreatitis occured year ago wellness ever since excellent health yr oldi highly endorse product get another cat someday feed grainfree food kittenhoodbtw also make grainfree dry food havent tried itgood luckallie

The bones are very greasy so be prepared to have some place for you dog to chew these.  I typically put her in her kennel until she gets it down to the nub.

(I make people use china coffee cups and am happy to wash them!)  These do not have the plastic outer cup.

Just add water to fill line over Ziti, cook 3 and 1/2 minutes in mcrowave, strain and add meat sauce.

5,THE BEST CHEW ON THE MARKET,"I adore this chew.  Two years ago I gave up chewing tobacco, the wife and the doc teamed up on me and finally convinced me it was time to stop playing chew Russian roulette.  It was tough to quit, I'd been chewing since I was eleven and half.  The idea was, give up the chew first and then tackle the cigarettes.  Well I'm happy to announce that last July with the help of hypnosis, the Patch, and plenty of nicotine gum, I am a non smoker!  Now watch, I'll get hit by buy a bus :) I'm just joshing.  Sure I put on a few pounds, a hundred and thirteen to be exact.  My shrink said I had an oral fixation and suggested a number of remedies, rebirthing, joggin, getting my jaw wired shut, tummy tucks, fake cigarettes, you know just something to stick in my kisser, hell I tried the works, but nothing seemed to do the trick.  Until accidently I stumbled upon these Antler Chews.  I had bought a couple for my dog ""Swiderski,"" and one night while he was enjoying one at my feet, I was having myself a plate of ribs watching the Braves game.  And you know me, all thumbs, I dropped a rib to the floor.  Well I reached down real quick to grab it and accidently picked up Swiderski's antler.  And Lawdy lawd I tell you what, I was home.  These are TAAAASSSSSTY, I'll never buy a pack of beef jerky again.  I've dropped eighty eight pounds to date, and I don't go anywhere without my new chew.  I keep one in the glove box of my truck, and I've got em in every room in the house. Hell I've fallen asleep sucking these chews.  I know it's somewhat of a cliche but they do taste a little like chicken, and I stress, they are not overwhelming.  I couldn't tell you how many packs of smokes I'd go through when I'd get to drinking my beer, but now I can go a good three or four months with just one antler.  Whew baby!  For any of you out there with an oral fixation or those who just wanna drop a few pounds, these deer antlers'll do the trick. My compliments to the chef.

I'm satisfied with my process and usually use Orville's, but recently found that I love the popcorn at Sundance Theaters. Sometimes I stop in their lobby just to pick up a bag of popcorn to take home for supper. I learned the trick of adding a touch of coconut oil to the popping oil and now I'm on a hunt for the best popping corn. I bought this even though to me the product and shipping cost was steep. I thought that if we bonded---me and the popping corn---it would be worth it. Well, it arrived poorly packed but intact. No matter, I made a batch of popcorn that night and settled in to watch ""Leverage."" The popcorn was tasteless. Made the same way as always, it was completely tasteless. I actually threw it out, which is so unlike me. I threw out the batch and I threw out the entire bag of popping corn. I've been an Amazon.com user since its inception and I think this is only my second poor review. If the popcorn and shipping cost wasn't so pricey it would be a small matter. I just don't want someone else to overextend themselves like I did in a purchase and have such a bad experience. I may be some kind of popcorn elitist, so let me just say that if you have gourmet tastes when it comes to popcorn and a slender pocketbook, don't take a chance on this brand unless you can try a smaller amount, closer to home.",Negative,love popcorn dont often want great popcorn odd may sound worked year get right im satisfied process usually use orvilles recently found love popcorn sundance theater sometimes stop lobby pick bag popcorn take home supper learned trick adding touch coconut oil popping oil im hunt best popping corn bought even though product shipping cost steep thought bondedme popping cornit would worth well arrived poorly packed intact matter made batch popcorn night settled watch leverage popcorn tasteless made way always completely tasteless actually threw unlike threw batch threw entire bag popping corn ive amazoncom user since inception think second poor review popcorn shipping cost wasnt pricey would small matter dont want someone else overextend like purchase bad experience may kind popcorn elitist let say gourmet taste come popcorn slender pocketbook dont take chance brand unless try smaller amount closer home

The cake mixes arrived two days later than expected, toward the end of our trip.  (Could have been T.S. Faye woes?) The even bigger problem?  We received the gluten free mix, which is okay I guess (doesn't taste as good) but not at all what I ordered.  I didn't really want to mess with it after that.

I am so impressed, I've become a Stash convert.<br /><br />This Double Chai is very well balanced in it's spices, but still comforting and yet refreshing at the same time. I made mine mostly according to the directions (tea is easy that way), but i did use sweetened condensed milk instead of regular milk and sugar. It may not be 'Starbucks Quality' as one reviewer lamented, but I'm sure the beauty of Chai is that it can be well made in a variety if different ways. And while i've never been big into Chai, in the future, I'm definitely going to keep a stock of this Chai tea in my pantry. And unlike many other common brands of black tea, this one does not go bitter after 5-10 minutes of steeping. I'm used to having to be vigilant about removing the bag after 3 minutes, because I'm sensitive to the bitter over-steeped taste of lower quality black teas.

5,Douwe Egberts Pods are the best,"I've tried numerous other pods with my Senseo, and I alway come back to the Douwe Egberts.

4,Best one I have found so far...,"I have tried a few other brands but this one tastes the most like regular pizza crust. The only thing I think it could use is some salt for flavor, as it is rather bland, so I will add maybe 1/2 tsp or more of salt the next time.

3,Room for quality improvement,"I love the concept. Living in New York apartment, it's great to be able to grow your own herbs. We use them for cooking and aromas are great. However in my first kit chives never came up. I spoke to customer support and they made me wait a few weeks before they have sent the chives replacement, but by the time it was too late, as all the other plants were huge, so the new seeds didn't really have a chance. I have planted my second kit a few weeks ago, and this time sage didn't sprout. Chives are also looking weak, dominated by huge basil and sorrel. Obviously, I am quite annoyed with dead seeds in both kits.",Neutral,love concept living new york apartment great able grow herb use cooking aroma great however first kit chive never came spoke customer support made wait week sent chive replacement time late plant huge new seed didnt really chance planted second kit week ago time sage didnt sprout chive also looking weak dominated huge basil sorrel obviously quite annoyed dead seed kit

4,As good as we had in Barcelona!,"We loved the assortment and it was ended up being more cheese than we had expected. The quality was excellent -- the manchego took us back to the wheel of cheese we bought on our honeymoon! Perfect with some pecans in honey. We'd definitely buy this again.<br /><br />The only complaint is that it was fairly warm when we got it. It was a mild day but not hot, and I'm concerned that the cheese might have melted on a warmer day or if the box had been out in the sun for longer than it was.",Positive,loved assortment ended cheese expected quality excellent manchego took u back wheel cheese bought honeymoon perfect pecan honey wed definitely buy againthe complaint fairly warm got mild day hot im concerned cheese might melted warmer day box sun longer
4,"Darker, stronger, please!","I love the convenience of Senseo pods--pop 'em in, fill the water tank, and press the start button. The dark roast is my favorite, but I wish Senseo would come out with a French roast and other darker, richer varieties. I know there's a Senseo espresso now, but it requries purchasing an espresso pod holder, so I haven't tried it yet. Perhaps it would work in my regular two-pod holder if I used one espresso pod and one dark roast pod...haven't tried it yet. That works with other pod brands that I sometimes use with the Senseo pods--one of each in the two-pod holder. I tried Senseo Sumatra, but didn't go back; less satisfying than the dark roast. We go through six to eight Senseo pods daily at my house, so I take advantage of the handy automatic order process through Amazon. I love serving Senseo dark roast coffee to guests. They're always impressed by the foamy head and fresh-made taste and aroma. It's good coffee, but I sure would like more darker, stronger varieties.",Positive,love convenience senseo podspop em fill water tank press start button dark roast favorite wish senseo would come french roast darker richer variety know there senseo espresso requries purchasing espresso pod holder havent tried yet perhaps would work regular twopod holder used one espresso pod one dark roast podhavent tried yet work pod brand sometimes use senseo podsone twopod holder tried senseo sumatra didnt go back less satisfying dark roast go six eight senseo pod daily house take advantage handy automatic order process amazon love serving senseo dark roast coffee guest theyre always impressed foamy head freshmade taste aroma good coffee sure would like darker stronger variety

It certainly was easy enough but...the bake time was more than the 20-22 minutes and my cupcakes didn't rise very well.  Old mix?  The buttercream frosting was very sweet and made as directed, did not seem thick enough to stay on the cupcake without sliding off.  The Lipitor advice?

5,Really good,"This KIND healthy grains vanilla blueberry clusters with flax seeds granola is really good. The blueberry is subtle enough that it doesn't overpower the flavor, and the sugar is sweet, but not overly sweet. Plus it is not high-fructose corn syrup or anything like that, it is just regular cane sugar juice and vanilla extract. In fact, all of the ingredients in this are just regular ol' stuff that you've most likely heard of. It's printed right on the front of the package: ""ingredients you can see & pronounce,"" and they mean it. Not only are the ingredients all just regular food, but you really can see all of them when you eat it. This stuff isn't coated in anything special to hide what it is, and it's not all ground up or anything into little pieces...it's all just right there and if you wanted to you could probably pick out all the different grains and stuff in it (gluten free oats, brown rice, buckwheat, amaranth, millet, quinoa, flax seeds). All this results in a granola/cereal that you can feel good about eating because there isn't anything weird in it; it's all natural ingredients and you can see what it is you're eating. There are supposed to be 11 servings within each package (each serving is 1/3 cup). I probably had between two and three servings when I'd be eating this for breakfast and it was plenty. It is pretty filling and I'm a big guy.

1,Too salty to eat,"These almonds had an unbelievable amount of salt on them. I love salt but this was over the top. I've bought this brand from other stores and they have never been this salty.

However, I didn't examine the picture closely enough, because I was surprised to see that the cans were not pull-tab and I had to dig out a can opener.  Inconvenient, especially since I feed my cats in the laundry room in the basement, not in our tiny kitchen.  Five or six of the cans were dented (I ordered a total of 24), a couple pretty severely.

5,What a great snack,These pouches are wonderful to keep in the diaper bag. They do not require refrigeration or heating so it's great for on the go. My son likes to hold the pouch and feed himself (warning: I always put it in his mouth for the initial squeeze or else he will squeeze so hard it flies in the air).  I also use them in the house for those days when he says no to all other foods. He has never turned down one of these pouches.

5,The Best,"I consider the GoLean ""chewy"" bars to be superior to any other nutritional bar out there, and I think this is the best flavor.  I often carry them for lunch (paired with a baggie of fresh veggies).  The calorie count is a little high for a snack for me, but as a lunch entree, it is low.  Highly satisfying, it has none of the over sweetness or ""roots and bark"" quality of many others on the market. It has a decent fiber count but never tastes mealy or grainy.",Positive,consider golean chewy bar superior nutritional bar think best flavor often carry lunch paired baggie fresh veggie calorie count little high snack lunch entree low highly satisfying none sweetness root bark quality many others market decent fiber count never taste mealy grainy
1,Half an antler might as well be no antler...,"I should have listened to the other one star reviewer. My antler was NOT like the picture.

5,I keep coming back to Nutiva,"I've tried other brands of VCO, but I keep coming back to Nutiva. It's well blended and smooth, and the flavor is the best of all I've tried. I love it and use it for all kinds of cooking. It's especially good for cooking bitter greens like turnips or collards; the coconut taste helps cut the bitterness, giving a marvelous flavor to the greens.<br /><br />I've discovered a fantastic way to make healthy popcorn using VCO. I've tried the stovetop method in the past using olive oil, but it's always burned my pot. What I do now is put a great heaping tablespoon of VCO into my 10-quart Fagor canning pot, melt it at 390 on my induction burner, dump in popcorn kernels to just cover the bottom in a single layer, and put on a glass lid I have that fits the pot. Then I just follow through with the popping process, jiggling the pot a little to keep the unpopped kernels falling to the bottom as the kernels pop. I listen for the popping to slow, just like you do with microwave popcorn, and then just turn off the induction burner and let the pot sit a minute while the last few kernels pop. This makes a wonderfully VCO-coated popcorn that can be enjoyed without salt if necessary, or add just a little fine popcorn salt and toss.",Positive,ive tried brand vco keep coming back nutiva well blended smooth flavor best ive tried love use kind cooking especially good cooking bitter green like turnip collard coconut taste help cut bitterness giving marvelous flavor greensive discovered fantastic way make healthy popcorn using vco ive tried stovetop method past using olive oil always burned pot put great heaping tablespoon vco quart fagor canning pot melt induction burner dump popcorn kernel cover bottom single layer put glass lid fit pot follow popping process jiggling pot little keep unpopped kernel falling bottom kernel pop listen popping slow like microwave popcorn turn induction burner let pot sit minute last kernel pop make wonderfully vcocoated popcorn enjoyed without salt necessary add little fine popcorn salt toss

He then tried it with apple juice, but just couldn't enjoy it.  My wife and I tried it and didn't like it either, so I can't blame the kids.  This stuff doesn't dissolve completely either, so it looks like your drink is full of sand (I swirled diligently).  I don't know what I'm going to add this stuff to so that it doesn't go to waste.

2,"One pro, lots of cons...","I have to say that I really wanted this formula to work for our son. My husband and I are big whole foods, organic people, and wanted that for our son as well when my milk supply never grew to be sufficient for him. This was clearly imperfect (only breast milk is perfect), but it was organic, and I didn't want my baby consuming chemicals.<br /><br />Everything worked out fine for about 4 weeks. Our son would spit up to some extent after almost every feeding, but we attributed it to HIM having some issues, not the formula. As he started to better ""communicate"" with us, we realized that he would cry nonstop during his feedings, which didn't seem normal. He would continue to suck, but would sob through his eating. It was heartbreaking. We burped him incessantly, thinking it may be gas, but it wasn't. He wouldn't sleep because he was so fussy, and nothing would calm him. He had a dirty diaper only once a day (sometimes even less), and they would often be harder than we would have expected.<br /><br />After doing extensive research, we started our little one on Gerber Good Start Protect. It contains only whey protein and not casein, which is known to create curds in baby's tummy (in ANYONE'S tummy, really). It also has probiotics (like breast milk). When we gave him his first bottle of the new stuff, he saw the bottle and started to pout, and once he started drinking, you could almost SEE the relief on his face. He did not fuss at all through his feedings, and he was instantly happier and calmer. My smiling, beautiful boy was back! After almost 9 days of naps of an hour or less, he got back to his regular 2-3 hour naps and better sleeping at night.<br /><br />While I want my son to have the most wholesome ingredients possible, I believe sometimes the way those ingredients are mixed can be a negative, and I think that may be the case with this formula. We'll continue with our Gerber Good Start, and as much breast milk as possible.",Negative,say really wanted formula work son husband big whole food organic people wanted son well milk supply never grew sufficient clearly imperfect breast milk perfect organic didnt want baby consuming chemicalseverything worked fine week son would spit extent almost every feeding attributed issue formula started better communicate u realized would cry nonstop feeding didnt seem normal would continue suck would sob eating heartbreaking burped incessantly thinking may gas wasnt wouldnt sleep fussy nothing would calm dirty diaper day sometimes even less would often harder would expectedafter extensive research started little one gerber good start protect contains whey protein casein known create curd baby tummy anyones tummy really also probiotic like breast milk gave first bottle new stuff saw bottle started pout started drinking could almost see relief face fuss feeding instantly happier calmer smiling beautiful boy back almost day nap hour less got back regular hour nap better sleeping nightwhile want son wholesome ingredient possible believe sometimes way ingredient mixed negative think may case formula well continue gerber good start much breast milk possible

I tried the syrup first in a protein drink (vanilla) and it was excellent.  I've tried the Torani SF English Toffee syrup and like the DaVinci better.  The pump works well with the glass bottle, and 4 pumps in 12 oz. of vanilla protein drink seems optimal.  I've found in the past that when using a pump in the plastic bottle, when the liquid gets down a couple of inches, just the slight compression of picking up the bottle can cause it to send liquid up and out of the pump.",Positive,surprised pleased received glass bottle rather plastic know nature fulfillment structure never know youll get tried syrup first protein drink vanilla excellent ive tried torani sf english toffee syrup like davinci better pump work well glass bottle pump oz vanilla protein drink seems optimal ive found past using pump plastic bottle liquid get couple inch slight compression picking bottle cause send liquid pump
5,Worth a Try.,"Our baby was born in early October. My wife wanted to feed him the way nature intended and we were visited by a lactation nurse at the hospital. She advised us and said that if we ever had problems with obtaining enough milk, we might try Fenugreek, a supplement available at health-food stores. Of course, we forgot the peculiar name shortly thereafter. Well, my wife started to have difficulties a few weeks later in keeping up with the baby's growing needs.  We mentioned the problem to a young couple who had a recent child. The woman said she had the same problem and told us to get Fenugreek. She said it had worked for her. There was that strange-sounding word again.<br /><br />We purchased Nature's Way Fenugreek shortly thereafter. Strange stuff. It's an herbal supplement in capsule form, but the label doesn't say what it's for. I guess you just have to know. Evidently, it's one of those things that takes a certain amount of faith. Anyway, since we heard about it from two completely independent sources, my wife started taking it. Well, it wasn't a miracle. There was no immediate change. However, my wife gradually began to keep up with the baby's needs and has kept up ever since. Was it the Fenugreek? Perhaps. Maybe she was just adapting to the new baby. It's hard to tell. However, if anyone is having this problem, I'd say the Fenugreek is worth a try.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",Positive,baby born early october wife wanted feed way nature intended visited lactation nurse hospital advised u said ever problem obtaining enough milk might try fenugreek supplement available healthfood store course forgot peculiar name shortly thereafter well wife started difficulty week later keeping baby growing need mentioned problem young couple recent child woman said problem told u get fenugreek said worked strangesounding word againwe purchased nature way fenugreek shortly thereafter strange stuff herbal supplement capsule form label doesnt say guess know evidently one thing take certain amount faith anyway since heard two completely independent source wife started taking well wasnt miracle immediate change however wife gradually began keep baby need kept ever since fenugreek perhaps maybe adapting new baby hard tell however anyone problem id say fenugreek worth trygary peterson

The sweet soy sauce is the main difference from other noodles.<br /><br />More importantly the online price @ $20 is double of what you would pay for at an asian grocery (i know not everyone has access to them but still good to know you're being ripped off).

When crushed and combined with a few other choice ingredients, they make a fantastic pie or dessert crust.<br /><br />So why only four stars?  Well, I've bought these ginger snaps many times at the grocery store, and never have I had so many broken cookies as in the box that Amazon sent.

5,Obese/overweight cat? Do your research!,"This is a really good choice for a nutritionally sound, lower calorie food, and our cat (admittedly not picky) immediately devoured it. But the real message here is: you need to find out how many kcal/day your cat needs for weight loss, research the calories in your cat's food, and accurately measure your feeding. There do not appear to be industry standards for what's labeled as 'weight management', 'light' etc., and the differences are dramatic!<br /><br />Our very young and energetic cat starting piling on weight from when he was a kitten. Maybe he stuffs himself because he's a 'rescue'--I don't know whether he might have had some starvation in his early weeks that marked him for life! but we had to put him on adult food before his kitten year was up, on the advice of our veterinarian--and he went on to gain weight up to almost 20 lb. even when giving the recommended daily amount of food, measured, divided into 2 daily feedings.<br /><br />We decided to switch from a Purina Pro Plan regular adult formula to their 'weight management' formula--still, kitty was gaining. When I finally did the research of how many kcal/day he should be getting and how many kcal we were giving him (mind you--the recommended, measured amount), I was shocked. The packaging recommends 56-84 g./day of the food for weight loss, for a cat with a goal weight of 10-14 lbs. That's 214-321 calories, measured by their own nutrition information.

And he did start losing, at a slow but safe rate: about .2 lb/week. But he was constantly, frantically hungry. I looked further, for a nutritionally sound food that could give him more volume and fill him up while still not exceeding the calories he would need for weight loss. With the help of [...] for nutritional ratings, and the calorie chart on [...], I selected Science Diet Light--with approximately 75% of the calories per cup compared to the Purina Pro Plan.

5,Bad Shipping,"Pero is an excellent substitute for coffee.  My father has been drinking it for years.  The product is awesome, however, when he received the package, 4 out of 6 canisters were broken open during shipping.  He is elderly, 88 years of age, and to him it was to much of an inconvience to repackage everything and return them to the post office and ship them back so he obsorbed the loss.

3,Tasty but disappointing,"I was excited to find this oatmeal made of real, easy to pronounce ingredients which came in a short list.  The oatmeal cooks up well and tastes great.  Unfortunately the amount of flax seed in this oatmeal made me nauseous.  Unfortunately the flax seeds were also whole, which means they're offering very little nutritional benefit.  Whole flax seeds are most likely to pass through mostly undigested.  Needless to say, I won't be purchasing the oatmeal again, but I've now been inspired to make my own, healthier version.  It is as simple as tweaking the recipe to my liking, and measuring out the dry ingredients into snack sized ziploc bags.  Super easy to grab a bag for work and it's not hard to estimate the amount of water needed.  If it weren't for the amount of (whole) flax seeds, I'd definitely buy this oatmeal again.",Neutral,excited find oatmeal made real easy pronounce ingredient came short list oatmeal cook well taste great unfortunately amount flax seed oatmeal made nauseous unfortunately flax seed also whole mean theyre offering little nutritional benefit whole flax seed likely pas mostly undigested needless say wont purchasing oatmeal ive inspired make healthier version simple tweaking recipe liking measuring dry ingredient snack sized ziploc bag super easy grab bag work hard estimate amount water needed werent amount whole flax seed id definitely buy oatmeal

1,Don't waste your money or your Keurig on this!,"This coffee tastes very flavorful and is not too strong, but I have to say it almost ruined my months' old Keurig Personal Brewer. The coffee is ground so finely that when the K-Cups are punctured by the needles (top and bottom), it gets packed into the needles and also sifts out through the holes made by the needles, going into the coffee cup creating a very nasty ""sludge"" in the bottom of each cup. I purchased a pack of 2 (48 K-Cups) and didn't even use one full pack. I do not recommend this brand or blend. It is a waste of money, which is something I couldn't really afford at this time. I sent a letter of complaint to the Wolfgang Puck company and, except for a ""cookie cutter"" letter acknowledging receipt of my comment, I have not received any further contact from them.",Negative,coffee taste flavorful strong say almost ruined month old keurig personal brewer coffee ground finely kcups punctured needle top bottom get packed needle also sifts hole made needle going coffee cup creating nasty sludge bottom cup purchased pack kcups didnt even use one full pack recommend brand blend waste money something couldnt really afford time sent letter complaint wolfgang puck company except cookie cutter letter acknowledging receipt comment received contact

3,Flavored Commercial Tea,"***<br />Stash's Lemon Ginger Caffeine Free Herbal Tea is a basic lemon ginger tea, tasting strongly of ginger, full of flavorings, and oddly, even contains soy. This is one of the better commercial highly processed, non-organic teas. I much prefer organic teas that are made without artificial flavorings and certainly without soy, but if you are not picky about herb teas, and are looking something very strongly flavored as an introduction to the world of teasans and decaffeinated beverages, this would be fine. If you like your tea more subtle, with true pure tastes, and can discern complex differences between natural and commercial teas, then this definitely is not for you, and I would recommend any Numi tea, Yogi Tea, Traditional Medicinals, or even Stash's organic line of teas (which comes in a wonderful Lemon Ginger Organic Tea!)<br /><br />Stash Lemon Ginger Tea contains ginger root, lemongrass, lemon flavor, safflower, hibiscus, citric acid, and soy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, nothing special.<br />***",Neutral,stash lemon ginger caffeine free herbal tea basic lemon ginger tea tasting strongly ginger full flavoring oddly even contains soy one better commercial highly processed nonorganic tea much prefer organic tea made without artificial flavoring certainly without soy picky herb tea looking something strongly flavored introduction world teasans decaffeinated beverage would fine like tea subtle true pure taste discern complex difference natural commercial tea definitely would recommend numi tea yogi tea traditional medicinals even stash organic line tea come wonderful lemon ginger organic teastash lemon ginger tea contains ginger root lemongrass lemon flavor safflower hibiscus citric acid soyunfortunately nothing special

2,Watery and lacking flavor,"I'm always on the lookout for a good salsa, and prefer salsas that deliver both robust flavor and heat. Sadly, Herdez fails on both accounts.<br /><br />My first impression when pour some salsa into a bowl was how much water there was. I had shaken the bottle prior to opening, and expected a better mix. The flavor was weak. For such a simple recipe I expected to taste tomatoes and onions, but there was really nothing there. The heat was also far short of what I expected from a salsa listed as hot. A little of an afterburn, but disappointing.<br /><br />I'll not be buying another bottle. The only reason this isn't a one-star review is that it is affordable and could be used as a base for a better home-brew salsa, but I expect to be able to dig in right out of the jar.",Negative,im always lookout good salsa prefer salsa deliver robust flavor heat sadly herdez fails accountsmy first impression pour salsa bowl much water shaken bottle prior opening expected better mix flavor weak simple recipe expected taste tomato onion really nothing heat also far short expected salsa listed hot little afterburn disappointingill buying another bottle reason isnt onestar review affordable could used base better homebrew salsa expect able dig right jar

So this time I did.  There are quite a few top quality foods out there that aren't full of grain and ""meat-meal"", but I chose wellness because it is a bit more affordable, and is popular enough to be available at local pet stores as well as online.<br /><br />Now the big hurdle...do the kittens accept it?  Well, mine sure did.  I was a bit worried because they had been eating mostly Royal Canin dry food at the breeders house, but they took to it immediately and now are very passionate about dinner time.  Excellent!  I couldn't be happier.  Expensive?  Yes, unfortunately it is, but it is actually cheaper than Royal Canin and several of the others and in the case of Royal Canin, it has *much* better ingredients!

One of them mentioned Mullein tea as a natural remedy to combat mucus, so I schlepped down to my local health food store to buy a box of 24 tea bags, for about a buck more than they are here on Amazon.  Not only did drinking this tea 3-4 times a day for a couple days have ZERO effect on my stuffy nose, but this was the worst cold/cough/flu I've had in about 10 years.

The key word on this package that got me to try it was Natural.<br /><br />I might be the only one but the biggest problem I have with flavored type coffee is not only the cloying taste but the extremely strong smell. If I want that strong a smell in my house I'll buy candles or spray. Usually, after about a fourth of the cup, I just don't want to drink much more - or smell it. I was very pleasantly surprised to find this coffee carries the trace of smell but it is neither strong nor overpowering. The taste follow suit - this is not a heavy roast and it does not have any bitter aftertaste. I found it exceedingly pleasant and finished the whole cup.

I think it would be a bit hard to eat as a snack, as the granola is fairly crumbly and not in large chunks. The chocolate as well is separate from the granola so hard to just eat from the bag. As a cereal, it tastes amazing! I probably would have liked a little *less* chocolate just so I didn't feel so much like I was eating candy, but I can't fault the taste at all, it really had a great blend of granola crunch, a bit of sweetness, and that semi-sweet chocolate taste that blended perfectly.

Sorry to be so graphic but that's the truth.  It's hard to give my dog food that I dont even want to touch.

5,"He loves it, and so do we!","This dry kibble was the third try in our quest to find a balanced kibble for our Bernese Moutnain Dog. There is plenty of technical information about what to feed your dog and, nearly overwhelmed, we entered the pet food market with an idea of feeding a quality kibble, but chose to avoid high-end designer food, high protein (>26%), bi-products, wheat, soy, and corn. We decided that whole grains, fruits, and vegitables would be an acceptable source of carbohydrates but wanted the ratio to be 40% or less (hard to do when you avoid high protien foods). We also believe chicken is the easiest protein source for our dog to digest. Lastly, we wanted to be near 24% Protien and 14% Fat. Keep in mind that our review below is based on our pet, and every pet will react to food differently.<br /><br />We fed Precise, which was only a great puppy food. We fed Canadae, which resulted in loose stool, gas and a pretty lethargic pet. We did some more research and decided to try Nature's Variety, the result was shocking! Our BMD had ZERO gastric upset during transition and became energetic again. Nature's Variety has produced nearly half the stools, which are small compact and virtually odorless. He has NO gas and his coat is shiny and feels conditioned. People are noticing the change and we couldnt be happier.

3,Prefer Other Clear Products,"When I first started using Clear products for my hair, I noticed a distinct difference in the health of my hair. After about two months of usage, other people have started noticing and commenting as well that my hair seems healthier. That is important to keep in mind as I review this specific product.<br /><br />I have very fine hair. Any little thing will weigh it down. In fact, that's the one complaint I had about the first Clear product I reviewed (Strong Lengths) - I lost what little volume I had. I didn't want to lose the benefits of the sleek, shiny healthiness I found with Strong Lengths from Clear, so I tried the Strong Lengths shampoo and the Volumizing Root Boost conditioner together before switching to the volumizing shampoo. To be honest, I didn't seem much of a difference with that combination.<br /><br />Next, I switched to using both the volumizing shampoo and conditioner. I did see a difference in the volume of my hair, but it also became more fly-away and less sleek. That has made it a little harder to manage, especially with my new short cut. (I made the switch two weeks after I got my hair cut.)<br /><br />I really don't like to use other volumizing solutions other than a little hair spray. But, I think I would prefer those over the results I get from this volumizing shampoo and conditioner. I'm glad to have the set. I'm glad to have tried it. And, if I still had long hair I might even like it. But, with my current hair cut, I doubt I'll go out and buy this product. I have no qualms, however, about sticking to the Clear brand.",Neutral,first started using clear product hair noticed distinct difference health hair two month usage people started noticing commenting well hair seems healthier important keep mind review specific producti fine hair little thing weigh fact thats one complaint first clear product reviewed strong length lost little volume didnt want lose benefit sleek shiny healthiness found strong length clear tried strong length shampoo volumizing root boost conditioner together switching volumizing shampoo honest didnt seem much difference combinationnext switched using volumizing shampoo conditioner see difference volume hair also became flyaway less sleek made little harder manage especially new short cut made switch two week got hair cuti really dont like use volumizing solution little hair spray think would prefer result get volumizing shampoo conditioner im glad set im glad tried still long hair might even like current hair cut doubt ill go buy product qualm however sticking clear brand

4,Interesting.,"I've never had ""raw"" carob powder before, so I thought I would try this out. It's not bad. Since it is not roasted, it has a very mild flavor, and is less chocolate-like than the roasted Carob.

I thought the price was a bit high, though.",Positive,ive never raw carob powder thought would try bad since roasted mild flavor less chocolatelike roasted carob use carob chocolatesubstitute would probably find product want appreciate carob separate individual food worth try thought price bit high though

4,"Good coffee, but needs a bit of cream","Melitta Caf&eacute; Collection Gourmet Coffee: Hazelnut Cr&egrave;me Brulee<br /><br />First of all, a summary, for those of you who only want the brass tacks: using a high-quality drip coffee maker, the result was a pleasurable but not perfect experience, and so I give this coffee four out of five stars. If you are willing to add good cream to your coffee, then I would even venture to give this blend a full five-of-five rating.<br /><br />Before I even opened the package, I was hit by the smell of its contents, the strong scents wafting through every tiny opening. The smell, however, was of cinnamon rolls, not of coffee. Cautiously cutting open the container, I put it to my nose and was rewarded slightly by the previously noted sugary odor mixed with a very gentle smell of ground coffee beans (the package didn't indicate the date of their grinding, but, having received them for review, I assumed they were relatively fresh.)<br /><br />I have to admit that I was a bit concerned about using the drip coffee makers because of the fineness of the grind, but nonetheless I approached them hoping for the best.<br /><br />One of the first things that struck my attention was the fact that the instructions on the side of the bag indicated a measure of two teaspoons of coffee per six ounces of water. The standard measurement for gourmet coffee is two tablespoons per six ounces. (Although two tablespoons per six ounces provides too strong a flavor for many people, it pulls out the best taste with the least amount of bitterness. Extra water should be added AFTER it has been brewed to lighten the coffee to the desired level. NEVER decrease the amount of coffee to make it less strong!)<br /><br />To properly determine the appeal of the coffee to the typical buyer, I decided to prepare the beans two ways:  (a) via a high-quality drip coffee maker using the ""two tablespoons of coffee grinds per cup of water"" measurement, and (b) via a more standard generic  drip appliance, using its recommended ""two teaspoons of coffee grinds per cup of water"" measurement.  I first tasted the results straight (without any added flavoring), and then with cream.<br /><br />Using the high-quality drip coffee maker, the results were quite satisfactory. The taste of smoky wood was definitely there, and the flavor brought to mind fire-roasted beans, slightly burnt to enhance their essence. The hazelnut flavoring was more of a scent than a taste, lingering on the tongue and in the nostrils after the rest has been swallowed.<br /><br />Good coffee prepared correctly should never be bitter. Never. So I was disappointed to find that there was, indeed, a small amount of bitter aftertaste in the cup I drank.<br /><br />Also to my disappointment was a bit of a sourness that permeated the entire experience, like the beans had been left to ripen a bit too long.<br /><br />To my surprise, one sensation that was not there was the sugar and cinnamon that hit me so hard when I initially opened the bag. I can only assume those flavors were run across the beans to provide a pre-brew experience to tantalize the potential buyer, but they didn't make it across after the water had been applied.<br /><br />So, as stated at the beginning of my review, using a high-quality drip appliance the result was a pleasurable but not perfect experience, and a good start for my tasting process.<br /><br />With the initial ""pure"" tasting complete, I added some cream to my coffee. The result was wonderful. All of the bad tastes were washed away instantly. No more sourness or bitterness. Granted, a coffee drinker should not have to rely on something external to wash away unpleasant side flavors, but in this situation it produced a cup I eagerly look forward to drinking again. Five out of five stars for that experience.<br /><br />Next, I turned to the ""department-store"" brand of coffee maker and used eight tablespoons (the equivalent of 24 teaspoons) with 12 cups of water. The result was passable. It retained most of the flavors of the stronger brewing but in a watered-down state. Unfortunately, the bitterness and sourness - the two worst flavors - came out in full force. Judging purely by this taste test, I would give the coffee at most three stars.<br /><br />Next I added cream and, to my pleasant surprise, it again completely wiped away all of the unpleasant flavors, leaving behind a delightfully light cup that flowed smoothly down my throat. Once more, five out of five stars.<br /><br />I should note that I gave the lighter version (with cream) to a friend who generally does not enjoy coffee, and she loved it, going so far as to say it was one of the best cups of coffee she had had in years.<br /><br />I generally don't like flavored coffees, but this one won me over as a good attempt and something I'm happy to keep on my shelf. Again I wish to note that I am disappointed that the addition of cream was a necessity in removing the very noticeable bad tastes from this blend, but at least they could be removed, which is more than I can say for many coffees out there.<br /><br />""Black as the devil, hot as hell, pure as an angel, sweet as love.""<br />-- Charles Maurice de Talleyrand (1754-1838) speaking of the perfect cup of coffee.<br /><br />Reviewed by Brianna<br /><br />Footnote from Grey: I agree with Brianna's review.

It might have limited value in camping situations or during other times where small cans make better travelers.<br /><br />It's not exactly a post-workout recovery drink.  Juice would be better.  Minute Maid juice, for instance, has less sugar and carbohydrates, even though Switch doesn't add any sugar.  And there are plenty of other juices that have more nutrients, including Calcium and other vitamins and supplements, including potassium.  So, it's less healthy than most juices.<br /><br />Switch isn't exactly a diet soda because of the natural sugar content comapared to zero sugar in diet drinks.<br /><br />As a regular alternative to sugared soda, it tastes good, but there is nothing really to distinguish it from other fruit-based sodas.  And, $22 a case, it's more than twice as expensive of sodas that come in bigger cans.<br /><br />So, in the end, Switch is worth a try but likely not something you will habitually buy.",Neutral,love juice love carbonated beverage difficult see product long retail lifeessentially good drink doesnt really anything wellit doesnt taste good enough juice replacementand really need juice replacement might limited value camping situation time small can make better travelersits exactly postworkout recovery drink juice would better minute maid juice instance less sugar carbohydrate even though switch doesnt add sugar plenty juice nutrient including calcium vitamin supplement including potassium less healthy juicesswitch isnt exactly diet soda natural sugar content comapared zero sugar diet drinksas regular alternative sugared soda taste good nothing really distinguish fruitbased soda case twice expensive soda come bigger cansso end switch worth try likely something habitually buy

That means 1/2 of the pouches seem to end up going to waste. I can remedy this by purchasing differently, but felt it was important since 3/3 pets agreed at my house.<br />-  If your cat is large, the portions will most likely be too small.<br /><br />Tip: Shake the pouch by holding it at the top before opening the top.  This pushes all of the juice down to the bottom of the pouch.  There is a chance when you rip it open that you'll get catfood juice on your hands if you don't.",Neutral,pro packaging keep portion noticeably fresher can portion cat ideal serving large cat kitten either pack seems right amount longer opened half full can food sitting around sometimes go waste dispensing bowl much clean process can variety flavor boxcons despite pro give star cat catfood eating dog dont ask eat pouch contain tuna mean pouch seem end going waste remedy purchasing differently felt important since pet agreed house cat large portion likely smalltip shake pouch holding top opening top push juice bottom pouch chance rip open youll get catfood juice hand dont

3,Mediocre,"The downfall of these cookies are not the way they taste, but the way they are advertised.

4,LOTTA chocolate here!,"I'm not a huge sweets fan, prefer chips and such normally, but every once in a while, like just about everyone, a sweet tooth bites me and I want something with some sugar in it.<br /><br />Having grown up in a family known for baking (grandmother used to make wedding cakes profesionally), cookies are nothing new.  And a good chocolate chip cookie can hit the spot sometimes, even for those of us who aren't THAT fond of chocolate.<br /><br />So the Chips Ahoy cookies here are a variation I haven't tried in their product line before.<br /><br />The cookie dough itself is about normal for them, not quite great but not bad, either.  A little squishier than I'd normally want, but these are supposed to be gooey after all, so that comes with the territory.<br /><br />And while the picture on the package shows something with just oodles of chocolate in the middle, while I think everyone knows it's a given that the picture is an exaggeration, I have to say it's not exaggerating by MUCH...  There's a LOT of chocolate in there compared to any other chocolate chip cookie.  For me, it was overwhelming, way too much chocolate.  My 7 year old said the same, took a bite, made a face, and threw the rest of it away.<br /><br />But these aren't being marketed to people who don't like chocolate, so our problem shouldn't be an issue with anyone that purchases these.<br /><br />Chocolate is pretty normal tasting mass produced cookie type of chocolate, with a pretty smooth consistency to it.  Again, nothing to rejoice about, but if you like a lot of chocolate in your chocolate chip cookiess, it will definitely float your boat.<br /><br />They're about the size of a silver dollar, give or take, so they're not very large, but given how sweet they are, I think anything larger would be overkill.<br /><br />If you like store bought prepackaged cookies, these should be just fine, if not a little better tasting than most of the other options.",Positive,im huge sweet fan prefer chip normally every like everyone sweet tooth bite want something sugar ithaving grown family known baking grandmother used make wedding cake profesionally cooky nothing new good chocolate chip cookie hit spot sometimes even u arent fond chocolateso chip ahoy cooky variation havent tried product line beforethe cookie dough normal quite great bad either little squishier id normally want supposed gooey come territoryand picture package show something oodles chocolate middle think everyone know given picture exaggeration say exaggerating much there lot chocolate compared chocolate chip cookie overwhelming way much chocolate year old said took bite made face threw rest awaybut arent marketed people dont like chocolate problem shouldnt issue anyone purchase thesechocolate pretty normal tasting mass produced cookie type chocolate pretty smooth consistency nothing rejoice like lot chocolate chocolate chip cookiess definitely float boattheyre size silver dollar give take theyre large given sweet think anything larger would overkillif like store bought prepackaged cooky fine little better tasting option

They had both just gotten off from working night shift, my son in law a 8-10hr shift and my hubby a 12hr shift. They had to work on the car so both took the 5-Hour energy shots and were up all day. Not only did it give them the energy to stay awake and alert enough to fix the car, they also fixed the mower, built on a clubhouse for the kids and cut up a fallen treee in the yard.

2,"I want to like this, but I can't","No MSG, no hormones, no antibiotics, makes for a great purchase in my book.  So why only two stars?  Unfortunately, after giving Golden Valley a chance with both this and their <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E4ARBE"">Sweet N' Spicy</a> flavor I couldn't make myself enjoy the taste.  The texture is strange, it reminds me of chewing cube steak.  You know it's beef but you also know it's a little too chewy to be steak.  It's possible people who like their steak rare may enjoy the chewy texture as it's not too tough as far as beef jerky goes.  Plus, something about the flavorings they use gives the meat a sour, almost rancid taste.  I'm guessing it's the apple cider vinegar as it reminds me of fruit or apple juice that's turning bad. They need to improve their flavors before I try them again.",Negative,msg hormone antibiotic make great purchase book two star unfortunately giving golden valley chance sweet n spicy flavor couldnt make enjoy taste texture strange reminds chewing cube steak know beef also know little chewy steak possible people like steak rare may enjoy chewy texture tough far beef jerky go plus something flavoring use give meat sour almost rancid taste im guessing apple cider vinegar reminds fruit apple juice thats turning bad need improve flavor try

4,"Very tasty, chewy and satisfying, although a bit too high in fat for me","I got these when Amazon was running a very good promotion, so it worked out to something like .60 a bar.  These have a really nice, tangy taste (the cherries) and a really satisfying chewy texture. I like that it's pretty natural and simple ingredients (grounds nuts, cherry, dates etc.), but for my preference, it's a bit too high in fat.  I like my energy bars to have no more than 3 grams of fat (or 4 max), while these have 8 (but then again, those lower fat bars don't taste as good as these).  ;-)<br /><br />I would try another flavor of these if there was another good sale and if I could get any that were lower in fat.",Positive,got amazon running good promotion worked something like bar really nice tangy taste cherry really satisfying chewy texture like pretty natural simple ingredient ground nut cherry date etc preference bit high fat like energy bar gram fat max lower fat bar dont taste good would try another flavor another good sale could get lower fat

1,Poor Substitution,"A Texas transplant to Maryland, it has been hard to find good chili mix at the grocery store.  For a brief and wonderful year, my local store carried my favorite, Wick Fowler's 2-Alarm Chili Kit.  Then they restocked with this stuff.  While it appears to be made by the same folks, it's AWFUL.  They've left out the onions, there's almost no cayenne pepper (they say to make it hot add the whole package, I would have needed about a half dozen of their little packages to even touch hot!), and the herbs and spices are all mixed together so there's not real sense of how much of anything you're putting in.

5,"Great results for allergies, company said ethoxyquin free","I have a beagle with bad food allergies, I started a different limited ingredient food and she still had loose stools so I decided to give taste of the wild pacific stream a try.

I can't say how good otherwise because its only been 2 weeks now, but so far so good and I called the company and they do guarantee that it is ethoxyquin free. It is also one of the top foods on dog food analysis. Since she is a beagle and only 25 pounds, I am pleased with the protein amount for a dog her size. The last food she was on was lower protein and some are to high for her size. I made sure this food was ethoxyquin free before I purchased it. She loves it. This is the first time in a year that her stools are formed, and not very loose. I am having her allergy tested in 2 weeks so I will know if its ok for her to stay on this food but so far eliminating grains for her has been great. I won't know the full effect until a few months as far as the itchiness and biting her feet, but so far this is helping her a lot. I will give an update once she is on it longer.

5,Perfect.,"Boy, does it make me sad to see so many people leaving comments about shipping problems as ""reviews,"" rating the product down because of the service received.  This salsa has only a 4 star average rating, strictly because of people who don't understand what a product review is, and it's unfair both to the manufacturer of the product (in this case a relatively small, family-owned operation in Texas called Riba Foods), nor shoppers who are trying to find a good product based on this review system.  How I wish Amazon would offer a ""this is not a review"" button as opposed to just ""helpful,"" ""not helpful,"" and ""abuse.""  (We can all click ""not helpful,"" but that doesn't counter the inaccurate product rating; and it's not ""abuse,"" just ignorance.)<br /><br />Here--before I get rightfully accused of hypocrisy--is my REVIEW of this SALSA: It's fantastic.  There are very, very few salsas sold in run-of-the-mill grocery stores marketed as ""hot"" that are actually HOT.  I have had ""hot"" salsas that list no type of hot chilies in the ingredients, and show it.  I have had ""hot"" salsas that were as tepid as canned tomatoes.  I have had ""hot"" salsas that, while tasty, just barely break the medium barrier.  This is not one of those.  It is actually spicy, how-about-some-milk, oh-dear-is-that-stomach-acid-in-my-throat-lining, this-can't-be-good-for-my-ulcer HOT!  I love it!<br /><br />An aside: The only other relatively widely available hot salsa that I can think of is Mrs. Renfro's Mango Habanero.  I love that one, too, but it suffers from the unfortunate problem of being too thin.  Watery thin.  With very few chunks.  The taste is fantastic, but the texture is monumentally disappointing.<br /><br />Well, not so with this one: The texture is perfect--it's thick and it clings to the chip.  You can see all the little flecks of roasted chili skin in there, and all the seeds, too.<br /><br />The one thing that threw me about this salsa--and made me bypass it several times before finally trying it--is that the ingredients list contains carrots.  ...CARROTS?  That's just weird.<br /><br />What's even weirder is that there is no hint of them in the salsa.  No carrot flavour, no carrot texture, and I can't find a chunk of carrot in that jar to save my life.  I suspect they might be pureed for thickening--maybe that's what makes the salsa thicker and more clingy than you usually get with a traditional Mexican roasted salsa like this one.<br /><br />You can taste the roasted pepper flavour, you can really feel the heat, the tomatoes are stellar, and it's not too salty (the tortilla chip provides enough of that!).  The burn lasts, too.  I find myself sucking air over my tongue for several minutes after I've stopped indulging.<br /><br />If you like truly spicy salsa without having to track down a specialty chilihead shoppe, and you know the deliciousness of roasted peppers (heck, roasted anything!), then give it a try.  I can't imagine you would regret it.<br /><br />Oh, and when you do try it and find you love it: Do everyone a favour and leave a review on the product about the PRODUCT.

4,Don't Expect These to Fool You!,"I saw these noodles at a local international food store.  I bought two packs because my husband and I are trying a low-fat, low-carb diet and I had been craving noodles.  Before I prepared them, I found a very helpful review here on amazon that gave some great tips on preparation:<br />1. Drain and rinse in a colander or sieve for a minute to remove most of the fishy smell. It is there, but you can rinse it off if you rinse it well.<br />2.  These are very long!  Much longer than your normal fettuccine noodle.  You might want to take kitchen shears and cut the noodles into thirds.  I usually leave them in the colander and snip around the pile of noodles.  It's not precise but it's easy.<br />3. Dry fry it in a frying pan for about 10 minutes on Medium.  You will notice the noodles become more opaque.  When you aren't seeing much wetness (not really standing water) in the pan when you move the noodles around, they are probably ready.<br />4. It may not be necessary but I remove them from the pan, prepare the rest of the dish, and then add them at the end.  I saute them in the pan with the other ingredients for about 5 minutes.<br /><br />Possible Preparation?  Try some soy, ginger, garlic, and chili paste.  Then add some tomato spinach, and mushrooms for a nice stir fry.  Or, shred some roast, saute it with some carrot and onion, spices and maybe a little bit of red wine for something like beef and noodles.<br /><br />The verdict?  These remind me of ramen noodles but with a little more bite to them.  They aren't a perfect substitute, but they work for me. They satisfy that craving for a noodle such that I am not feeling deprived. If you're on a diet that does not allow noodles, or if you are just trying to cut carbs, I think you have to set the right expectations.  They aren't meant to be an exact substitute.  You have to eat them with the knowledge that you are looking for an acceptable substitute.",Positive,saw noodle local international food store bought two pack husband trying lowfat lowcarb diet craving noodle prepared found helpful review amazon gave great tip preparation drain rinse colander sieve minute remove fishy smell rinse rinse well long much longer normal fettuccine noodle might want take kitchen shear cut noodle third usually leave colander snip around pile noodle precise easy dry fry frying pan minute medium notice noodle become opaque arent seeing much wetness really standing water pan move noodle around probably ready may necessary remove pan prepare rest dish add end saute pan ingredient minutespossible preparation try soy ginger garlic chili paste add tomato spinach mushroom nice stir fry shred roast saute carrot onion spice maybe little bit red wine something like beef noodlesthe verdict remind ramen noodle little bite arent perfect substitute work satisfy craving noodle feeling deprived youre diet allow noodle trying cut carbs think set right expectation arent meant exact substitute eat knowledge looking acceptable substitute

It was a single serve machine and when it arrived the bags did not work with that specific machine.

5,WAY better than canned (prep instructions included),"I used to buy this product in bulk from Wild Oats, but haven't been able to find it in several years (Wild Oats was bought out by Whole Foods and the one near me doesn't carry this in bulk). I was so happy to find this product in bulk on Amazon (whether buying 12 7oz. boxes or buying the 3 3.3lb bags which is what I bought). Yes, it's a ton of mix, but I make this so often and it lasts practically forever provided it's kept sealed.<br /><br />The flavor is so far superior to anything canned and, dare I say, even better than refried beans made at home. This is mainly due to the extra flavorings added to the mix whereas home recipes usually only add salt and/or garlic. This product is perfect for anyone who loves refried beans and wants a convenient way to prepare them. I think it's incredible that something this easy and fast to prepare actually tastes better than something you can make at home (that also takes much longer). It's great for quick bean and cheese burritos or breakfast burritos (bean, cheese, and egg with some red sauce) and also great for campers. Plus, if you buy the 3 3.3lb bags, you can divide this product up and make as much or as little as you need.<br /><br />Preparation information:  Many sites I researched for this product said to mix 1.75C boiling water with 1C of mix in a bowl, cover, and let sit for 5 mins.  However, THIS IS INCORRECT and results in runny beans.  I contacted the good folks at Fantastic Foods and was forwarded preparation instructions which are as follows.<br /><br />Pour 1.75C boiling water of 1 1/3C of mix in a bowl.  Stir well, cover and let sit for 5 mins.<br /><br />I haven't tried this ratio yet as I just received the email and wanted to post a review including the instructions since they all seem to be incorrect everywhere I look.  If the beans are still too runny for you, increase to 1.5C of mix and try that.  I personally like my beans very thick for both eating plain and in burritos.",Positive,used buy product bulk wild oat havent able find several year wild oat bought whole food one near doesnt carry bulk happy find product bulk amazon whether buying oz box buying lb bag bought yes ton mix make often last practically forever provided kept sealedthe flavor far superior anything canned dare say even better refried bean made home mainly due extra flavoring added mix whereas home recipe usually add salt andor garlic product perfect anyone love refried bean want convenient way prepare think incredible something easy fast prepare actually taste better something make home also take much longer great quick bean cheese burrito breakfast burrito bean cheese egg red sauce also great camper plus buy lb bag divide product make much little needpreparation information many site researched product said mix c boiling water c mix bowl cover let sit min however incorrect result runny bean contacted good folk fantastic food forwarded preparation instruction followspour c boiling water c mix bowl stir well cover let sit minsi havent tried ratio yet received email wanted post review including instruction since seem incorrect everywhere look bean still runny increase c mix try personally like bean thick eating plain burrito

4,"Oooh, la la !!!","Folger's scores another coup with their awesome French Vanilla ground coffee. The taste is delicious. It keeps a long time in your kitchen cabinet or your freezer, too. If you do choose to keep it in your freezer, however, remember to let it thaw out a few hours before using.<br /><br />The canisters are very well constructed to keep the ground coffee fresh and the safety seal on the top of each unused canister gives you peace of mind. The packaging overall is excellent.<br /><br />But of course it's the coffee that we're really interested in here. The freshness of that distinct French Vanilla flavor strikes your taste buds and makes you really, REALLY want that second cup of coffee. It's a delicious way to wake up in the morning; and of course it's good at any time of the day or night as well.<br /><br />Obviously, coffee contains caffeine. If you are sensitive to caffeine in any way you might prefer to drink decaffeinated coffee instead of this product. If you have any questions at all about your specific medical situation consult your doctor.<br /><br />There's only one minor disappointment: the label says that this coffee contains ""added natural and artificial flavors."" I wish that Folger's had told us exactly what these ingredients are. That way people could make an even more informed decision about whether or not they would want to drink this coffee. I am taking off one star for this to make this a four star review. I truly believe in ingredient labels that tell what ALL the ingredients are and not just some of them.<br /><br />Overall, however, this is one great French Vanilla coffee.

4,Micromoisture? Really?,"What can you say about a body wash? Does it get you clean? Yes. Well isn't that enough?<br /><br />Apparently not because this one has MICROMOISTURE technology. All these jargon words really make me laugh. You know there is a room of marketing guru's just sitting around thinking, ""what words can we put together that will make our product sound revolutionary?""<br /><br />This team came up with: patent filed technology (yes that's right, ""filed""), micromoisture technology, clinically proven, dermatologist recommended, and total skin comfort. I'm sure one of these is a typo on the container.<br /><br />But let's talk about the product now.<br /><br />Smell - it smells clean, masculine, not overpowering. It reminds me a bit of an Axe body spray.<br /><br />Texture - it has ""purifying grains"", which means it's sort of like using lava soap but in liquid form. It's gritty but not in a tear-up-your-skin way. That grit is supposed to help wash away dead skin cells and leave your skin refreshed and clean. I would have to say that yes, it does make my skin feel nice afterward.<br /><br />Where to use it - it says ""body and face"" but I don't really like micro-beads getting into my eyes. Be cautious about that. Great for body, not for the eyes - so when you're scrubbing your face be sure to squint really tight until you wash all the grit off.<br /><br />So what do I like? It smells good and it leaves my skin feeling like it's been cleaned very well.<br /><br />So what don't I like? It's not a shampoo & body wash, just a body wash, so I wind up having to use shampoo as well. This won't apply for bald men, but for the rest of us - I don't recommend using this as a shampoo because it takes forever to wash the microbeads out of your hair.<br /><br />As advertised the product gets 4 stars.

Unfortunately, I think they unloaded their oldest/worst batch on me. The chips tasted stale, leached out a ton of oil ( I m not kidding, felt like I was eating pizza given how much oil i was leaching out with a napkin from each individual chip!) and the taste was just off. I think with all the oil that leached out, it upset the flavor balance of the chip and now they just taste really salty and stale.<br /><br />Tried 3 different bags, and it was the same in each case (couldnt eat more than a couple of chips, they were that bad).

4,"The manna is quite good, but what a royal pain to use - if you live in cold weather areas, order this in summer","Does it taste good? Yes. If you like the taste and texture of coconut butter, you will most certainly like this product.<br /><br />Does it spread nicely? Well, that depends on where you live and how patient you are. In cold weather this is a royal pain to use because the oil separates and hardens at temperatures below 76 F. The instructions on the label say to place the container in hot water for 5 to 10 minutes to soften the manna. Well, in my kitchen (room temperature about 70 F) it took almost a half hour for this thing to melt.<br /><br />I placed the jar inside a stainless steel saucepan filled with hot water that must have been at least 180 F. After 5 minutes the water had cooled quite a bit and yet the oil had not even started to melt. I used a blunt knife to try and break the manna into pieces. Did the same thing two more times. Finally, the fourth water change did the trick and the manna now had acquired a nice consistency, perfect for spreading, but at that point I was not a very happy camper.<br /><br />I wanted to use this as a breakfast spread and that's not going to happen, at least not during the week. I just don't have the time nor the patience. It just takes too long.<br /><br />I buy natural organic peanut butter, which also must be mixed well for the oil to combine, but I only have to do that once so I don't mind at all. With this manna it's an everyday event.<br /><br />I ordered two jars, one of them will live in my pantry until next summer, and we'll treat coconut manna as a warm weather food, I guess.<br /><br />This is a very nice tasting coconut product, which I would have rated 5 stars otherwise. Certainly worth a try, if you happen to keep your house above 75 F year round.",Positive,taste good yes like taste texture coconut butter certainly like productdoes spread nicely well depends live patient cold weather royal pain use oil separate hardens temperature f instruction label say place container hot water minute soften manna well kitchen room temperature f took almost half hour thing melti placed jar inside stainless steel saucepan filled hot water must least f minute water cooled quite bit yet oil even started melt used blunt knife try break manna piece thing two time finally fourth water change trick manna acquired nice consistency perfect spreading point happy camperi wanted use breakfast spread thats going happen least week dont time patience take longi buy natural organic peanut butter also must mixed well oil combine dont mind manna everyday eventi ordered two jar one live pantry next summer well treat coconut manna warm weather food guessthis nice tasting coconut product would rated star otherwise certainly worth try happen keep house f year round
3,"4 stars for quality and taste, 3 stars for the price","I like Stevita products and these are no exception. You don't have to worry about the ingredients, because everything is natural and there are no surprises here. The taste is good, albeit a little weak compared to similar ""Aspartame"" flavored products.

5,Delicious chocolate way to get 14grams of fiber and only 2 net carbs per bar,"These Chocoperfection bars taste so good, you'll never believe they are good for you!  I get these at my local Jimbo's for $3.85each but am hoping they will be available from Amazon soon!  What a delicious way to g35 14grams of fiber!<br /><br />Instead of sugar, Chocoperfection uses erythritol which has 95% fewer calories than sugar, 93% fewer than maltitol, and no effect on insulin levels, and oligofructose, a sweet tasting dietary fiber made primarily from chicory (not the same as fructose).<br /><br />These silky-smooth, delicious chocolate bars actually help you lose weight because the high fiber content and the high fiber content also acts as an appetite suppressant.<br /><br />And unlike maltitol-sweetened chocolate, ChocoPerfection bars will never upset your stomach, give you gas, make you bloat, or stall your weight loss.  Chocolate Perfect!<br /><br />On top of all that, Chocoperfection is diabetic-safe and tooth-freindly, too.  What more could you ask of a chocolate bar?<br /><br />What is erythritol?<br /><br />Like xylitol, erythritol is a polyol or sometimes called a sugar-alcohol (although none of them contain sugar or alcohol,) and has some of the cavity-fighting similarities.<br /><br />Xylitol is as sweet as sugar and has about 2/3 the calories.<br /><br />Erythritol, on the other hand, is about 70% as sweet as sugar and and almost zero calories.  Plus it is better tolerated by most people<br /><br />with less gastronomical or laxative reactions.  By the way, XylitolNow sells erythritol in bulk on the main product page.<br /><br />Being only 70% as sweet as sugar, erythritol sometimes needs a little help in the sweetness department. In the case of these bars, that's where oligofrutose comes in.<br /><br />What is oligofructose?<br /><br />Oligofructose<br />From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br /><br />Oligofructose, sometimes called Fructooligosaccharide or just  (FOS), is a subgroup of inulin, specifically those fructose polymers with a degree of polymerization (DP) &lt;= 10. Unlike most carbohydrates, it is not digested in the human small intestine and thus has a lower calorific value, whilst contributing to dietary fiber. Oligofructose is on the more soluble side, due to its lower chain length, than the general class of inulins and is therefore commonly used as an additive to yoghurt and other dairy products. It is used specially in combination with high-intensity artificial sweeteners, whose sweetness profile and aftertaste it improves. Oligofructose is also a prebiotic stimulating the growth of bifidobacteria in particular.<br /><br />Food Sources<br />FOS is extracted from fruits and vegetables like bananas, onions, chicory root, garlic, asparagus, barley, wheat, and tomatoes. The Jerusalem Artichoke has been found to have one of the highest concentrations of FOS. (In the case of Chocoperfection, the oligofructose is extracted from chicory root.)<br /><br />Health Benefits<br />FOS has been a popular dietary supplement in Japan for many years and is now becoming increasingly popular in Western cultures for its prebiotic effects. FOS serves as ""fast food"" for the probiotic beneficial or ""friendly"" bacteria that naturally populate the gut, increasing their ability to benefit overall Gastrointestinal Tract (GI Tract) health, especially proper digestion. It has also been touted as a supplement for preventing yeast infections.<br /><br />And this from Steggall Nutrition:<br /><br />Oligofructose is a tremendous substrate for bifidus bacteria, stimulating its activity by several hundred percent. This is called prebiotic activity, referring to stimulation of health promoting bacteria in the intestinal tract. Short chain fatty acids are produced, lowering pH levels and providing an energy source for the growth and maintenance of large intestine cells. This process leads to differentiation of cancer cells, a vital step that is required before cancer cells can be killed.<br /><br />The ideal environment for healthy bacteria is quite different to the environment preferred by pathogens and gram negative putrefactive bacteria. Consequently the undesirable bacteria diminish in number as the healthy bacteria proliferate in the presence of oligofructose.",Positive,chocoperfection bar taste good youll never believe good get local jimbos hoping available amazon soon delicious way g gram fiberinstead sugar chocoperfection us erythritol fewer calorie sugar fewer maltitol effect insulin level oligofructose sweet tasting dietary fiber made primarily chicory fructosethese silkysmooth delicious chocolate bar actually help lose weight high fiber content high fiber content also act appetite suppressantand unlike maltitolsweetened chocolate chocoperfection bar never upset stomach give gas make bloat stall weight loss chocolate perfecton top chocoperfection diabeticsafe toothfreindly could ask chocolate barwhat erythritollike xylitol erythritol polyol sometimes called sugaralcohol although none contain sugar alcohol cavityfighting similaritiesxylitol sweet sugar calorieserythritol hand sweet sugar almost zero calorie plus better tolerated peoplewith less gastronomical laxative reaction way xylitolnow sell erythritol bulk main product pagebeing sweet sugar erythritol sometimes need little help sweetness department case bar thats oligofrutose come inwhat oligofructoseoligofructosefrom wikipedia free encyclopediaoligofructose sometimes called fructooligosaccharide fo subgroup inulin specifically fructose polymer degree polymerization dp lt unlike carbohydrate digested human small intestine thus lower calorific value whilst contributing dietary fiber oligofructose soluble side due lower chain length general class inulin therefore commonly used additive yoghurt dairy product used specially combination highintensity artificial sweetener whose sweetness profile aftertaste improves oligofructose also prebiotic stimulating growth bifidobacteria particularfood sourcesfos extracted fruit vegetable like banana onion chicory root garlic asparagus barley wheat tomato jerusalem artichoke found one highest concentration fo case chocoperfection oligofructose extracted chicory roothealth benefitsfos popular dietary supplement japan many year becoming increasingly popular western culture prebiotic effect fo serf fast food probiotic beneficial friendly bacteria naturally populate gut increasing ability benefit overall gastrointestinal tract gi tract health especially proper digestion also touted supplement preventing yeast infectionsand steggall nutritionoligofructose tremendous substrate bifidus bacteria stimulating activity several hundred percent called prebiotic activity referring stimulation health promoting bacteria intestinal tract short chain fatty acid produced lowering ph level providing energy source growth maintenance large intestine cell process lead differentiation cancer cell vital step required cancer cell killedthe ideal environment healthy bacteria quite different environment preferred pathogen gram negative putrefactive bacteria consequently undesirable bacteria diminish number healthy bacteria proliferate presence oligofructose

I'm not sure I'd drink it daily, but for a nice reprieve from plain water (I can't drink artificial sweeteners, so most sugar-free drinks are out), it's nice.

3,SodaStream alternative,"The flavor is labeled as fruit punch, and it bears a resemblance to Hi-C Fruit Punch, but not as sugary. With the recommended mixture, it tastes like watered-down Hi-C. If you add more, it tastes fruitier without becoming overly sweet. However, it doesn't taste very natural, again like Hi-C. There are no discernible fruit flavors. It's a vague sort of fruitiness, like Vitamin Water Zero.<br /><br />I also tried it with my SodaStream. The carbonation dulls taste buds, so the soda water needs a lot of syrup for full flavor.<br /><br />It claims to be an energy drink, but I didn't notice any boost in my energy.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: All in all, it's not bad, but it's not great. For people who dislike plain water, this makes it less boring without overwhelming you with fruit flavors or sugary sweetness. But if you need energy or something sweet, you should buy a can of soda-pop.<br /><br />SIDE NOTE: It was suggested to me that it might be okay for masking the off-flavors of cheap vodka.

5,Great Aroma,"This coffee had all the rich flavor that I expect from a dark roast and minimal bitterness.  I suspect most folks are checking these reviews to find out if these weird cups actually work in a Keurig machine.  They do.  I had no issues.  The unexpected benefit was the great coffee aroma.  I love the Keurig system, but I miss the smell of coffee before it is prepared.  The aroma is back with these as soon as you open the plastic bag that they come in.  As much as I enjoyed the aroma, I felt compelled to store these things in another air-tight container, lest they lose their freshness. I also decided that I could not keep these cups in the rotary K-cup holder that we keep next to our machine.<br /><br />Despite storage issues, I would get these again for their flavor, aroma, and price.",Positive,coffee rich flavor expect dark roast minimal bitterness suspect folk checking review find weird cup actually work keurig machine issue unexpected benefit great coffee aroma love keurig system miss smell coffee prepared aroma back soon open plastic bag come much enjoyed aroma felt compelled store thing another airtight container lest lose freshness also decided could keep cup rotary kcup holder keep next machinedespite storage issue would get flavor aroma price

As a diabetic, I really enjoy having something sweet that does not spike my blood sugar.  I grew up loving black licorice.  (If it is not black, it is not licorice.)

ANYWAY, I was making stir fry over rice and needed a new taste and decided to try this bottle of Iron Chef, I mean how could Morimoto steer me wrong? It was actually a good blend of spicy and sweet, it blended well with the chicken and cabbage and onions.

5,A yummy treat,"I admit it.  I just love snack foods.  And amongst my favorite snacks to eat are cookies.  I can't think of a year that I haven't ordered Girl Scout cookies and Oreos are amongst my favorite cookies (especially double stuff Oreos).<br /><br />So I was excited to have the opportunity to try the new ""Peanut Butter Creme Oreo Fudge Cremes"".  While I think that they could shorten the name of these cookies a bit, the bottom line is that they are yummy.<br /><br />The only description on the bag is ""fudge covered chocolate cookies"" so they could probably expand on that a bit.  But basically, it tastes like a single cookie wafer with peanut butter creme stuck to the side and then the whole thing covered in a soft fudge.<br /><br />The bag I received was 11.3 ounces, which is a generous size.  It is also resealable, so not only is it very easy to get at the cookies without a knife, scissors or your teeth, but it's also easy to reseal the bag and keep the cookies fresh.  Of course they probably won't be around long anyway, because you're going to gobble them up.  At least, that's what I expect to do.<br /><br />I really like these cookies.  If this was a Girl Scout cookie, I'm sure they'd sell very well.  I definitely do recommend them.

1,One word..... bleckkkk.,"I'm not opposed to change,but I do oppose change when change wasn't needed in the first place. I am so disappointed in Necco's misguided decision to change their classic Sweethearts conversation hearts. Once a great traditional candy they're now just gross.

5,Excellent Alternative To Milk - Vaniilla Nice Change From Plain...But The Shipping Charge - YIKES!,"Westsoy brand soy milk(in choices of Plain and Vanilla) is one of the only brands so far,that I have found that has an unsweetened choice in other flavors than plain - they even have a chocolate unsweetened but it's hard to find.If you have a Trader Joe's market near you, you may also find their own brand in the unsweetened variety.I try to stay away from sugar and dairy products is a thing of the past for me.I started using this several years ago. I have found that almost anything I used with milk, I can use this instead. The only time I prefer milk is in my coffee, and even then I use ""Lactaid"", which is a lactose free milk. Coffee-wise, I just like the creamier consistency better and also the soy milk seems to break up in hot coffee.<br /><br />I use Soymilk in my cereal, both hot and cold, and it's a wonderful replacement for milk or ice cream when used in a smoothie, with some ice and fruit(or any flavor you want to add.) Works great as a glass of soy with any meal.A refreshing taste, that, after a while you may even think is better than milk. The Vanilla, which is naturally flavored, gives just a hint of flavor to make it a little different then the plain for a little variety. But the Plain is good too.<br /><br />It's a a great source of Protein, with 9 grm. per 8 oz. serving,and 46 mg isoflavones, it also supplies 4% calcium and 10% iron in each serving. Ingredients are Organic Soymilk(filtered water, whole Organic Soybeans),Natural Vanilla Flavor With Other Natural Flavors. Per serving it supplies 100 calories, 4.5g Fat, 0.5saturated fat, 0 g of trans, 2.5 polyunsat fat,1g monosat fat. NO cholesterol(this is always a big plus for me),30mg sodium 300 mg potassium, 4 gr dietary fiber and 1g sugars (not added but coming from the ingredients). The only thing it lacks is the Vit D that is added to milk, so you may have to check around and find another source for that of something you like.<br /><br />Packaged in a slim 32 0z. box, with an easy pour recloseable spout, it has a long shelf life, and should be refrigerated once it's open, at which point it is usually good for about a week to 10 days. The price is about the same, give a take a few cents, as it is at my neighborhood grocery store...BUT-The shipping is so high, this is one product I would not recommend to buy on line. Maybe Amazon will eventually have a multi-pack site with the free shipping option. If anyone has come across such a site please leave a comment on my review - or if I come across one I will edit with the info-thanks!<br /><br />For dairy free diets, Westsoy is a good, healthy choice.<br />Remember to breathe, eat healthy and enjoy....Laurie",Positive,westsoy brand soy milkin choice plain vanilla one brand farthat found unsweetened choice flavor plain even chocolate unsweetened hard findif trader joes market near may also find brand unsweetened varietyi try stay away sugar dairy product thing past mei started using several year ago found almost anything used milk use instead time prefer milk coffee even use lactaid lactose free milk coffeewise like creamier consistency better also soy milk seems break hot coffeei use soymilk cereal hot cold wonderful replacement milk ice cream used smoothie ice fruitor flavor want add work great glass soy meala refreshing taste may even think better milk vanilla naturally flavored give hint flavor make little different plain little variety plain good tooits great source protein grm per oz servingand mg isoflavones also supply calcium iron serving ingredient organic soymilkfiltered water whole organic soybeansnatural vanilla flavor natural flavor per serving supply calorie g fat saturated fat g trans polyunsat fatg monosat fat cholesterolthis always big plus memg sodium mg potassium gr dietary fiber g sugar added coming ingredient thing lack vit added milk may check around find another source something likepackaged slim z box easy pour recloseable spout long shelf life refrigerated open point usually good week day price give take cent neighborhood grocery storebutthe shipping high one product would recommend buy line maybe amazon eventually multipack site free shipping option anyone come across site please leave comment review come across one edit infothanksfor dairy free diet westsoy good healthy choiceremember breathe eat healthy enjoylaurie

5,Delicious,"Oatmeal is good for you, but I have always hated the taste.  The Maple & Brown Sugar flavor of Quaker Instant Oatmeal has always been my favorite way to eat it.  I started with the regular version, then moved to the Lower Sugar option, and have finally settled on the Weight Control variety.  The Weight Control tastes great and smells like waffles.<br /><br />One reviewer of this product was disappointed by the fact that when he compared the Weight Control version to the regular Quaker Instant Oatmeal, he realized that Weight Control has the same number of calories (160) and more fat (3g instead of 1g), but you need to analyze the products as a whole.  There may be more fat in the Weight Control, but if you look at the other components of the product, you'll see that Weight Control has fewer calories coming from carbohydrates (29g instead of 33g), BUT it has two times more dietary fiber (6g instead of 3g) and a lot less sugar (1g instead of 13g!).  More dietary fiber and less sugar is what you should really be looking for in your carbs anyway.  Weight Control also has almost twice as much protein as regular (7g instead of 4g).<br /><br />There is more to think about with your food than how much fat it contains.  Quaker Instant Oatmeal Weight Control fit my family's needs, but you should make sure you really look at the different products' nutritional information.

I hope this will bring Kenya to him in small way. I really can't wait to see his face when he unwraps it on Christmas! It only took a few days to receive the tea.

I am very happy with this purchase, and I can't wait to sit and have a cup with my husband like we did every morning in Kenya! :) I very much recommend this tea to any tea drinker.

5,Excellent Buy,"This coffee is an excellent buy.  I only use it for making lattes with my Rancilio Silvia, so I cannot comment on whether the bean makes good drip coffee.<br /><br />As a point of comparison, the beans are way better than Starbucks decaf espresso, and somewhat better than the well-advertised Lavazza beans.  The Coffee Bean Direct beans are not quite as good as Caffe Umbria Mezzanotte Decaf Blend.  Nevertheless, considering the incredible price difference between Coffee Bean Direct and Caffe Umbria, Coffee Bean Direct is a great choice.<br /><br />To be clear, I am not saying that you have to settle on flavor - the coffee is fantastic. Most people who have tried the lattes I make with the Coffee Bean Direct beans with the Silvia and the Rocky grinder cannot believe how great the coffee is or that it is decaf.  Like the other reviewers said, the grind is very important in order to get the great flavor and crema.  So if you are initially disappointed, experiment with your grind, dose, tamp, etc. until you get a great shot.<br /><br />I freeze the beans in air-tight plastic bags, and only take out small amounts of beans at a time.  I remove any air in the bag before returning the bag to the freezer.  If I don't, then the coffee becomes bitter/sour.  I average a couple of lattes a day, and a single bag lasts about 3 months.",Positive,coffee excellent buy use making latte rancilio silvia comment whether bean make good drip coffeeas point comparison bean way better starbucks decaf espresso somewhat better welladvertised lavazza bean coffee bean direct bean quite good caffe umbria mezzanotte decaf blend nevertheless considering incredible price difference coffee bean direct caffe umbria coffee bean direct great choiceto clear saying settle flavor coffee fantastic people tried latte make coffee bean direct bean silvia rocky grinder believe great coffee decaf like reviewer said grind important order get great flavor crema initially disappointed experiment grind dose tamp etc get great shoti freeze bean airtight plastic bag take small amount bean time remove air bag returning bag freezer dont coffee becomes bittersour average couple latte day single bag last month

5,works very nicely,"I have experimented with different flour blends. I was trying to find something to use for pancakes without having to buy a mix. This blend makes great pancakes. My recipe called for 1Tablespoon of baking powder. We were getting an aftertaste until I finally cut the bp back to 2tsp. Now it is hard to tell the difference between wheat ones and these. I also use it for other baking, and it works alright. It doesn't have the wheat flour texture/taste because it is not wheat flour, but it works better than some other blends, and is healthier than some that have hard-to-pronounce ingredients that I have no idea what they are. Keep up the good work Namaste! And thank you for making gf living a little easier.",Positive,experimented different flour blend trying find something use pancake without buy mix blend make great pancake recipe called tablespoon baking powder getting aftertaste finally cut bp back tsp hard tell difference wheat one also use baking work alright doesnt wheat flour texturetaste wheat flour work better blend healthier hardtopronounce ingredient idea keep good work namaste thank making gf living little easier

4,I Truly Enjoyed Them,"If you absolutely love ginger snaps then you will love these cookies! I loved the overall flavor because it had a strong ginger taste. I don't particularly like weak tasting ginger snaps.  The strong flavor may not be for everyone but I truly enjoyed them.  The only reason why I didn't give them five stars was because they were a little hard to bite into.  These were the hardest ginger snaps that I have ever had but other than that, they taste really good.  I also like the fact that I didn't experience any aftertaste which was a huge plus!",Positive,absolutely love ginger snap love cooky loved overall flavor strong ginger taste dont particularly like weak tasting ginger snap strong flavor may everyone truly enjoyed reason didnt give five star little hard bite hardest ginger snap ever taste really good also like fact didnt experience aftertaste huge plus

5,Healthy treats for dogs,"I love that these are made with organic ingredients and a short list at that:<br />  ""organic barley, organic lamb, organic carrots, organic apples, organic palm  oil (preserved with mixed tocopherols, a source of vitamin E), organic molasses""<br /><br />I usually get my dog Milk-Bones (Milk Bone Gravy Bones), which is something I can pick up at my grocery store. And I've always felt like maybe I was buying her junk. But whenk I look at the ingredients for milk-bones, they're maybe not that bad.<br /><br />(Ingredients for regular Milk-Bones, from their web site: Ingredients: Wheat flour, beef meal and beef bone meal, milk, wheat bran, beef fat preserved with tocopherols, salt, dicalcium phosphate, wheat germ, natural flavor, calcium carbonate, brewers dried yeast, malted barley flour, vitamins (choline chloride, dl-alpha tocopheryl ecetate [vitamin e], vitamin a acetate, calcium pantothenate, riboflavin, vitamin b12 supplement, d-activated animal sterol [source of vitamin d3]), sodium metabisulfite (dough conditioner), minerals (zinc sulfate, copper sulfate, ethylenediamine dihydriodide [source of iodine]).) Amazon product link: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043P1OIU"">Milk Bone Gravy Bones Biscuits for Small and Medium Size Dogs, 19-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a><br /><br />If you have a dog with allergies, or want to feed your dog organic foods, the Newman's are definitely the thing. They are about twice as expensive as the milk-bones at Amazon, FWIW, but that is consistent with many organic foods.<br /><br />I have tested my dog a few times to see which she prefers, making her sit and putting one of each on the floor. The first time, she went straight for the Newman's. The next several times, she went straight for the Milk-Bones. So I think she likes the Milk-Bone treats better, but she likes them both.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. organic ingredients and a short list<br />2. dog likes them<br />3. scored, so that it's easy to break them in half (most of the time)<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. more expensive<br /><br />That's the one con, right?

5,great in the mornings!,"This tea is the perfect wake-up beverage when I stumble out of bed.  It really does give you that much-needed ""oomph"" to start out with.  I recently weaned myself from coffee and a friend suggested Twinings.  I bought the sampler package and settled on two favorites; Irish Breakfast in the mornings and Lady Grey in the afternoon.  It is rather strong though, depending on how long you let it steep.  I would suggest the minimum the first time just to get an idea of the flavor; at first I used a little half-and-half and a dallop of honey, but now I prefer it straight-up, just because I don't have that kind of time.",Positive,tea perfect wakeup beverage stumble bed really give muchneeded oomph start recently weaned coffee friend suggested twinings bought sampler package settled two favorite irish breakfast morning lady grey afternoon rather strong though depending long let steep would suggest minimum first time get idea flavor first used little halfandhalf dallop honey prefer straightup dont kind time

But, if you read on the seasonal mix, the delectable medley is only sweet potato & taro.  There are several colors of sticks makig you think you're getting several different vegetables, but actually you're getting the same two vegetables, w/some dyed by beet juice.

2,Didn't tickle my taste buds,"Although touted as an all natural beverage, it did not taste that way. I caught what seemed a taste of an artificial sweetener. The maker says it is sweetened by honey, glucose and sucrose. Not anything artificial there. My tongue must have misled me.<br /><br />It matters little, though, since I did not like the taste.

5,"Not exactly like traditional potato chips, but a great substitute","One of my biggest frustrations with doing Weight Watchers was always the problem of finding good chips.  I will eat the baked ones, but they are undeniably very different from regular fried chips.  In addition to this, I've never been able to find a baked chip that came in salt and vinegar flavor, which is my favorite type of chip.  This meant that, whenever I had the craving for this particular flavor, I'd have to eat the regular fried kind.<br /><br />I picked up an oversize bag of the barbecue flavor Pop Chips on a whim at Costco.  I'd heard about them and was curious about what they're like, but I'd never before been able to find them in the area.  Much to my surprise, my very thin husband who is totally addicted to barbecue chips loved them and pretty much ate the whole bag before I'd had any.  I had tasted a couple of them and thought the barbecue flavor was good, so I decided to go ahead and order the individual bags from Amazon in barbecue for him and sea salt and vinegar for me.<br /><br />They are definitely worth the money.  I want to emphasize, however, that you will not be fooled into believing these are the regular old fried chips.  The taste and texture is something like a cross between rice cakes and chips.  I say rice cakes because they have something of that puffed look that rice cakes do.  Still, they are very good and the salt and vinegar is nice and strong, which is just the way I like them.<br /><br />As for the portion size, it's pretty generous.  For my fellow Weight Watchers, they are 2 points per bag, and they definitely make for a satisfying, filling snack or a side for your sandwich.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend these to anyone who is sick of the limited flavors of baked chips and would like something that comes in a wider variety of more exotic flavors.  I'm planning on trying the parmesan and garlic next.",Positive,one biggest frustration weight watcher always problem finding good chip eat baked one undeniably different regular fried chip addition ive never able find baked chip came salt vinegar flavor favorite type chip meant whenever craving particular flavor id eat regular fried kindi picked oversize bag barbecue flavor pop chip whim costco id heard curious theyre like id never able find area much surprise thin husband totally addicted barbecue chip loved pretty much ate whole bag id tasted couple thought barbecue flavor good decided go ahead order individual bag amazon barbecue sea salt vinegar methey definitely worth money want emphasize however fooled believing regular old fried chip taste texture something like cross rice cake chip say rice cake something puffed look rice cake still good salt vinegar nice strong way like themas portion size pretty generous fellow weight watcher point per bag definitely make satisfying filling snack side sandwichi would definitely recommend anyone sick limited flavor baked chip would like something come wider variety exotic flavor im planning trying parmesan garlic next

4,Improves Mental Clarity?,"Tazo's Focus tea is a blend of black tea, lemon balm, chicory, cocoa peels, roasted yerba mate, rose petals, citrus essence oil, rosemary and natural flavors. To me it mostly tastes like a mild lemony tea. It tastes pretty good with a few tablespoons of powdered milk (so it doesn't dilute the taste like milk would) and a packet of stevia. What I've noticed with this tea is how it makes the world shimmer. It is as if you are more aware of beauty when you have had a cup of this tea. I've read negative and positive things about yerba mate. So I think it is best to drink this tea occasionally and not to drink it instead of your normal tea or coffee. It is good if you want to focus on reading a good book but this tea can also make you a bit jittery from the caffeine. I also noticed that this was a good appetite suppressant. When I drank this a few hours before dinner I ate way less than normal. I was only eating a salad but made it much smaller than a dinner salad and even skipped adding the chicken. This tea also contains theobromine which is found in chocolate. Since some articles online state that yerba mate causes cancer and others say it cures cancer it is probably best to do your own research before deciding if you want to drink this tea.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review",Positive,tazos focus tea blend black tea lemon balm chicory cocoa peel roasted yerba mate rose petal citrus essence oil rosemary natural flavor mostly taste like mild lemony tea taste pretty good tablespoon powdered milk doesnt dilute taste like milk would packet stevia ive noticed tea make world shimmer aware beauty cup tea ive read negative positive thing yerba mate think best drink tea occasionally drink instead normal tea coffee good want focus reading good book tea also make bit jittery caffeine also noticed good appetite suppressant drank hour dinner ate way less normal eating salad made much smaller dinner salad even skipped adding chicken tea also contains theobromine found chocolate since article online state yerba mate cause cancer others say cure cancer probably best research deciding want drink teathe rebecca review

5,Happy Chihuahua,"My long haired chihuahua is overweight. Her ideal weight is approximately 6-7lbs, however she currently weighs approximately 9lbs (this is my fault, I overdid it on the treats). She loved her Wellness brand super5mix adult formula for small breeds kibble, but I recently noticed the small breeds weight reduction version being sold at PetSupermarket, and decided to switch her over.<br /><br />I was worried she would not like it, as I had once unsuccessfully tried to switch her over to the other Wellness Super5Mix weight control kibble (purple bag, normal sized kibble). Surprisingly she took to the taste of the Wellness Small Breed Weight Control kibble almost immediately. I didn't even need to ween her off of the Wellness original kibble, just gave her the weight control formula and she liked it, no problems with her digestion. The color of the kibble is slightly less brown than the original adult formula, but she did not seem to notice a difference at all. She likes the small size of the kibble, and recently I have noticed that she has lost about 4 ounces... not much but it is a start. Hopefully with exercise and some restraint by me, she will be within her normal weight range, but I am happy I made the switch and will continue to purchase this brand.<br />TIP: My dog is a picky eater, so I sometimes mix a bit of water into the food which causes the food to give off an aroma, which draws her to it. It also makes it easier for her to eat because it softens the kibble. It's also good because it keeps her hydrated... Just an FYI.",Positive,long haired chihuahua overweight ideal weight approximately lb however currently weighs approximately lb fault overdid treat loved wellness brand supermix adult formula small breed kibble recently noticed small breed weight reduction version sold petsupermarket decided switch overi worried would like unsuccessfully tried switch wellness supermix weight control kibble purple bag normal sized kibble surprisingly took taste wellness small breed weight control kibble almost immediately didnt even need ween wellness original kibble gave weight control formula liked problem digestion color kibble slightly less brown original adult formula seem notice difference like small size kibble recently noticed lost ounce much start hopefully exercise restraint within normal weight range happy made switch continue purchase brandtip dog picky eater sometimes mix bit water food cause food give aroma draw also make easier eat softens kibble also good keep hydrated fyi
5,One caveat...,"This tea is great! It is very sweet on its own- I like to alternate drinking it with sips of water, which makes the licorice flavor even more pronounced!<br /><br />Just use caution if you have high blood pressure or glaucoma.

I noticed a change in the color within the past 5 years.  The original spice was closer to black in color and you only needed to use a little.

5,What do you get the dog that has everything?,"I will admit, my dog is spoiled. Not in a ""dressed in pink, riding around in my shopping cart spoiled."" Just loved and adored every day.<br /><br />Crockett does not play with rubber chew toys and is not allowed to have rawhide (for health and safety). He has figured out every treat-dispensing toy (of about 15) that we own. They only take him minutes to conquer. However, this everlasting treat ball is a constant challenge. The challenge is not in the replaceable treat ""caps."" The challenge is between the inner, triangular flaps in the center.<br /><br />The first time that we gave him this toy, we only put one treat cap (official ""Everlasting"" treat) on one end - you can put one on each end if you prefer. It took him about 20 minutes to devour - a record for any treat-dispenser. Pretty soon he taught us that he could now get those suckers out in 3-5 minutes. However, we raised the bar and started putting his standard treats between the flaps in the middle. It takes us and him a little work (we have to pry the flaps back with our fingers and poke the largest bits possible inside). It is worth it to watch him contentedly gnaw at this toy for up to 30 minutes. Changing the inside treat is the trick because each type takes a little different tactic - cookie-like treats require the lick-it-raw approach, hard, meatish treats need some good crunching, and dried, real meat (think jerky) requires just the right angle.<br /><br />In fairness, Crockett is not a chewing kind of dog. If it's not food, he won't put his teeth on it. So, the first day that he carried this into the kitchen in his mouth when I came home from work, I almost collapsed in surprise. (The rubber that this treat ball is made from is softer than most pet toys and seems more appealing to Crockett.)<br /><br />Stats: Crockett is a pitbull/kelpie mix and weighs about 40 lbs. He works well with the med-sized ball, but isn't a crazy-chewer by nature. He is good with his paws and will hold a toy in different ways to get it ""just right.""

5,"I have to say, it is what is cracked up to be.","I've been making and eating rice throughout my entire life of 43 years now.  I've done quite a few fancy ad-hock rice dishes, putting together anything I like in my Zojirushi and Cuckoo rice makers.  Recently, I got interested in making authentic Spanish Paellas.<br /><br />The first thing I discovered was that the ingredients are expensive.  Real Spanish saffron, Spanish Chorizo, and Spanish Paprika are rare and expensive items even in Los Angeles California.  Rabbit isn't easy to find either.  Nevertheless, I went through with the program and decided to build and authentic Paella.  After watching a plethora of YouTube videos, Pau Gasol on local TV, two episodes of Tyler's Ultimate, and one episode of Good Eats, I felt I had a grasp on the essentials.<br /><br />One thing the Spaniards stress: You can fool around with a lot of ingredients, but there are three things you cannot compromise on (1) authentic and pure Saffron, (2) Calisparra Bomba from Valencia, (3) real smoky-hot Paprika from Spain, (4) Good extra-virgin olive oil.  You also need to use an authentic high-carbon steel Paella.  These are quite inexpensive.  I got a fully legit one from Valencia (import duty tag and everything) for just $20 bucks.  I also gathered that I should use chicken thighs, rabbit meat, and chicken stock for fluid.<br /><br />To make a long story short I purchased a 5 pack of this very expensive rice wondering if it was going to live up to the praises heaped up to the heavens upon it.  Chefs called this the rock-n-roll star of the rice world.  They called it the Rolls Royce of Rice.  They said it was unbeatable.  I was more than skeptical.  I have eaten a lot of rice in my life--a thousand pounds or more by now--and I've tried a lot of different types.  They're all different in one way or another but they are all good.<br /><br />According to the poop-sheets, Bomba is absolutely unique because of it's ability to absorb 3x its mass in fluid, yet it never gets sticky or sloppy. It's hard to overcook.  I've made a lot of rice with a lot of varieties of rice.  All of them call for 2:1 ratio of fluid to rice, never 3:1.  All sources said 3:1 when you use Bomba.  Bomba is more delicious because it absorbs 50% more fluids, and 50% more flavors (measure for measure) than any other form of rice<br /><br />To make a long story short, I made my first authentic Spanish Paella 2 days ago.  It blew my brains out, and I don't say that lightly.  I've had a bunch of delicious rice dishes in my time, but this beat them all.  This was like a revelation from God.  I can see why many serious-minded gourmet chefs like Alton Brown, Tyler Florence, Guy Fieri, Paula Dean et al, obsess about getting this dish done right.  It's pretty frickin' stunning; a flavor explosion.<br /><br />Bomba is delicious rice.

2,I'll Take A Chance...,"Like Lawyer Reader said in an earlier review, these things arrived at room temperature.  Shipping essentially doubles the price of these little fish, so you might assume that they get shipped in a reliable and safe way.  Not so.  It comes in a small box with little insulation and a couple of (melted) ice packs.  I'm going to eat them anyway.  I'll update this review when (if) I survive, but when one orders high-end food products, one expects first-rate handling of the product by the shipper.

5,A Real Treat,"I bought these in NYC during the great blizzard of 12/26/10, to take with me on Amtrak, as my flight home was canceled.  I shared them with my seat mates, and we all thought they were delicious.  Different from regular Nature Valley granola bars, sort of a cross between a granola bar and a candy bar.  As I was packing up to get off the train (after a 9 hour trip!) I still had one pack of 2 bars left, and heard a woman with a french accent ask the snack bar operator if he had any chocolate left.  He said ""no"", and I handed her my last pack, told her it was as good as a chocolate bar, and left feeling good about sharing something so delicious.",Positive,bought nyc great blizzard take amtrak flight home canceled shared seat mate thought delicious different regular nature valley granola bar sort cross granola bar candy bar packing get train hour trip still one pack bar left heard woman french accent ask snack bar operator chocolate left said handed last pack told good chocolate bar left feeling good sharing something delicious

4,"Very good coffee...lower caffeine, but probably not no caffeine.","I typically only like to drink Timothy's and Emeril's coffees.  I like coffee strong, without bitter aftertaste.  For a decaf, this is great coffee.  It's not as bold as Timothy's Midnight Magic or Rainforest Espresso (my 2 favorite caffeinated coffees), but for an afternoon or evening coffee that won't keep you up all night, its great.  Only downside is that I think it has more caffeine than other weak decaf coffees.  I like it, but it does affect sleep.  On a positive, if you have it in the afternoon/evening, it might give a LITTLE bit of a much needed pick-up, without getting you overcaffienated as can happen if you have too much regular coffee!",Positive,typically like drink timothy emerils coffee like coffee strong without bitter aftertaste decaf great coffee bold timothy midnight magic rainforest espresso favorite caffeinated coffee afternoon evening coffee wont keep night great downside think caffeine weak decaf coffee like affect sleep positive afternoonevening might give little bit much needed pickup without getting overcaffienated happen much regular coffee

5,The absolute best K cup coffee available,"I love espresso in the evening, and good dark American coffee in a french press in the morning. I thought Starbucks was good until I tried Alterra, which is the best for whole beans. I tried about 30 kinds of K cups after buying the machine for something faster.  I learned that the extra bolds are the only ones with much flavor, that the ""espressos' are certainly not espresso, that some are too bitter and almost muddy, and I settled on the Green mountain Sumatran. It was not nearly as full flavored or as good as my french press using Alterra Brazilian bourbon coffee, but in a hurry it was much faster than grinding beans, boiling water, mixing it in the french press, and waiting 5 minutes to push down the plunger and drink the coffee. But recently when I tried to reorder, Amazon was out and I searched for a new K cup coffee. I was scientific, as I read all Amazon reviews on extra bold coffees that received almost unanimous 5 star ratings, ordering 4 of them to try: Tully's Sumatra, Van Houtte Taste of Europe 100% Colombian (I never knew Colombia was in Europe?), Caribou Mahogany, and Timothy's Extra Bold Parisian Nights coffee. I have rated and tried them over and over and they always rank Parisian #1, Mahogany a not too distant #2, Sumatran #3, and Colombian (the lightest one) a distant #4. I then later tried Parisian against my old favorite Green mountain Sumatran, and clearly Parisian is the absoute best. It is still not as good as my french press coffee, but it has good deep flavor without bitterness and I do not feel deprived when I drink it in the morning.",Positive,love espresso evening good dark american coffee french press morning thought starbucks good tried alterra best whole bean tried kind k cup buying machine something faster learned extra bold one much flavor espresso certainly espresso bitter almost muddy settled green mountain sumatran nearly full flavored good french press using alterra brazilian bourbon coffee hurry much faster grinding bean boiling water mixing french press waiting minute push plunger drink coffee recently tried reorder amazon searched new k cup coffee scientific read amazon review extra bold coffee received almost unanimous star rating ordering try tully sumatra van houtte taste europe colombian never knew colombia europe caribou mahogany timothy extra bold parisian night coffee rated tried always rank parisian mahogany distant sumatran colombian lightest one distant later tried parisian old favorite green mountain sumatran clearly parisian absoute best still good french press coffee good deep flavor without bitterness feel deprived drink morning

2,Potato Styrofoam Tubes...,"These are nothing like french fries. When you open the bag, a bunch of little tube-shaped flavorless ""potato sticks"" are staring back at you. They are literally the consistency of styrofoam. Ever had cheese curls? They're the texture of that, but the exterior is smooth. It is extremely odd. Due to the smooth exterior, the ""sea salt"" (which I find to be remarkably similar to table salt) doesn't stick. So the entire bag is covered in salt, but very little ends up being on the actual ""fry""<br /><br />I'm sitting here eating a bag as I type this, and honestly, it's really hard for me to finish. They don't even taste like potato. They taste like paper. Salty paper. I mean if you're into bland and tasteless food, this will be right up your ally.

4,Compared to other dark or bold brews...,"Like many others, the price point of this coffee got my attention but what's the point of cheaper coffee that's all but undrinkable... Grove Square, anyone?<br /><br />So before ordering on price alone I wanted to see other reviewers contrast and compare this blend to other k-cups such as Timothy's Midnight Magic, Emeril's Extra Bold or Jet Fuel. After all, given the wide disparity of opinion about which k-cup blend is bold, strong or rich in flavor, at least finding common ground with others who enjoy the aforementioned brands you can estimate the appeal of the flavor to your own palate.<br /><br />At the time I placed my order I didn't find any clear indicators from other reviewers along these lines, hence for what it's worth, as one who enjoys the previously mentioned k-cups, I can say that overall San Francisco Bay French Roast measures up pretty darn well to the more expensive brands.<br /><br />Now if cost were not a factor I'm not certain this would be my first choice as this blend has a somewhat smoky after taste and I prefer a more fruity or sweet flavor. But hey, this is French Roast and as such the taste seems well suited.<br />Nevertheless, no regrets...it's a nice bold brew (with an appealing price) that I look forward each morning.",Positive,like many others price point coffee got attention whats point cheaper coffee thats undrinkable grove square anyoneso ordering price alone wanted see reviewer contrast compare blend kcups timothy midnight magic emerils extra bold jet fuel given wide disparity opinion kcup blend bold strong rich flavor least finding common ground others enjoy aforementioned brand estimate appeal flavor palateat time placed order didnt find clear indicator reviewer along line hence worth one enjoys previously mentioned kcups say overall san francisco bay french roast measure pretty darn well expensive brandsnow cost factor im certain would first choice blend somewhat smoky taste prefer fruity sweet flavor hey french roast taste seems well suitednevertheless regretsits nice bold brew appealing price look forward morning

3,Taste good but not quite Thai Spicy,"I am an expat living in Thailand so I know a thing or two about Thai spicy. While the jerky I received was moist and flavorful, I would not consider it a true Thai taste profile. Although there was a hint of Thai spice, there was no redolent Thai flavor starring in the jerky. At the same time the heat level was what I would call a small baby 1 on a scale of one to ten. I don't think the heat level would have even bothered a baby. Being labeled Thai spicy and living in Thailand I expected this product to deliver a wallop of flavor and, unfortunately, I got a small sweet kiss of what could have been. A valiant effort but way of the target. Would I eat it again? Yes if free or highly discounted. Would I give it to a Thai friend as a gift. No way, they would laugh at the silliness of calling it spicy, when it clearly is not spicy in the Thai meaning of the word.

It was metallic tasting and very bitter. It wasn't expired, so I'm not sure what was the problem. I couldn't return the item (since I guess you can't return food and beverages, even if it's defective), so I ended up throwing it all away. It made me mad because I wasted money. Just an FYI - I have had several similar issues with other food items from Amazon, so I'd be careful to order food and beverages from Amazon. I guess the items stay in their warehouses for long periods or something because I've gotten melted gummy bears, stale crackers, and more bad tasting tea (Celestial Seasonings).

What was in the box was basically the winnings from some cat lottery.  A case of seafood dinners-Yellowfin, Snapper, Tuna & Sole, & Tuna & Shrimp.  I was sleeping when my person stood with my treat dish poised above my nose.  ""Don't bug me"" I thought as I sleepily eyed what she had in hand....A TREAT!<br /><br />I quickly followed into the kitchen to partake of a delicious entree of Red Snapper.  This totally looks like peoplefood!  I scarfed down a half a can immediately and if there was a pattern at the bottom of my bowl I would have licked that off as well.  That was one clean dish.  I've been told that tomorrow we'll try maybe Yellowfin, which sounds equally good.<br /><br />Likes:  looks like peoplefood, smells good, not overly fishy, and they add vitamins and no wheat gluten....hm, not sure about that one, but apparently wheat gluten isn't good.

I would have thought it'd have a dark chocolate taste, but instead it was only vaguely chocolate. Checking the ingredient list it appeared to have a soy based filling with artificial flavors.

1,Strange Fragrance,"This extract doesn't smell like roses at all.  It has a very herbal smell, something like lavender but not as pleasant.  I'm very disappointed.

5,"Stash Premium Fusion Red, White & Blueberry Tea","Amazing tea.<br /><br />That pretty much sums it up - it's an amazing tea. The taste is sweet and the smell is strong and also sweet. I love waking up, steeping a teabag with two teaspoons of cane sugar and half water half milk mixture. Adding milk gives the tea an amazing body and unlike a reviewer said below, there is no notes of green olives nor of cough syrup - this tea is simply astounding.<br /><br />I've tried Stash's Mango/Passion fusion and their Chai tea but didn't care for those, then I stumbled upon this one and O-M-G is all I had to say. The Chai has a somewhat bitter aftertaste and the Mango/Passion is forgettable on the palette. This tea however I love. The smell like I said is strong, super strong, and sweet. The taste is also amazing, very fruity and very very endearing. However, on the downside, I would not recommend that you make this tea with water alone, although it is a very smooth tea, it lacks body - thus, like I said before, make it as follows:<br /><br />Steep in 4oz hot water with 2 teaspoons of cane sugar (or substitute your own)<br />Add 4oz warm milk<br /><br />The milk as I said gives it extra body that the tea lacks, however it is forgiveable. Stash truly hit the mark on this one and hopefully they don't discontinue it - because the day they do discontinue it, I will be a very very sad man :(",Positive,amazing teathat pretty much sum amazing tea taste sweet smell strong also sweet love waking steeping teabag two teaspoon cane sugar half water half milk mixture adding milk give tea amazing body unlike reviewer said note green olive cough syrup tea simply astoundingive tried stash mangopassion fusion chai tea didnt care stumbled upon one omg say chai somewhat bitter aftertaste mangopassion forgettable palette tea however love smell like said strong super strong sweet taste also amazing fruity endearing however downside would recommend make tea water alone although smooth tea lack body thus like said make followssteep oz hot water teaspoon cane sugar substitute ownadd oz warm milkthe milk said give extra body tea lack however forgiveable stash truly hit mark one hopefully dont discontinue day discontinue sad man

5,"Lemon Lotusade? Lemonotusade? Whatever you call it, it's great!","In the time since I first discovered blue lotus, I've tried several conventional and a few unconventional methods to to consume it. The first time I got the powder, I just sort of grabbed a handful and dumped it into my mouth. That did not go well.<br /><br />Next I tried dumping a few tablespoons into yogurt and then eating it. That also did not go well.<br /><br />I tried buying the plant itself and burning it, steeping it in hot water, and even tossing it into a salad, but overall, my favorite method was making a tea out of the powder.<br /><br />Or so I thought. I decided to try the mood drink despite my apprehensions, and boy am I glad I did! When I got it, I opted to have two servings at once, since I'm what you might call a tall drink of water (or lemon lotus drink, as the case may be), and after making the drink and seeing how easily it dissolved , I resisted my urge to pinch my nose and down it in one.<br /><br />It tasted GOOD! And I don't mean the sort of ""good"" where you grimace and rasp ""H-hey, this is *cough* kind of good!"", I mean good like a nice glass of lemonade, with a hint of blue lotus. There was no annoying grit (the biggest problem I have when I make tea, but that's my fault) and it had a nice effect that wasn't too overbearing. Yet another highly enjoyable experience from a company that actually cares about the quality of their merchandise.<br /><br />BONUS RECIPE: Lemon Lotus Piledriver<br /><br />Ingredients<br /><br />1-4 servings of Lemon Lotus Mood Drink<br />1 bottle of Perrier or something similar<br />1-4 tablespoons of lemon juice<br />Vodka (Citrus works well, but plain is fine too)<br />2 pinches of lemon salt<br />Ice<br /><br />Directions:<br />Mix lemon lotus powder with room temp vodka, mix until drink powder is thoroughly dissolved.<br />Add in Perrier and lemon juice, put into shaker with ice and shake vigorously.<br />Pour into highball glass, garnish with lemon wedges or lotus ice cubes and serve.<br /><br />PS: Check out my blog for more recipes and such!

If you're like me and like strong, smooth coffee, you'll discover that not many of those hundred will give you the flavor you're looking for.  Newman's Own Organics Extra Bold, for me, is the best way to go.  I've tried maybe 20 or 30 different K-Cups that tout the word ""strong"" or ""dark"" etc...  This is definitely my favorite (Starbucks is pretty good too).  But at a reasonable price of about .65 a cup, you really can't go wrong with Newman's Own.<br /><br />I brew this EARLY in the morning, and it wakes me up.

The spicy taste lingers in your mouth for a bit but it's not a hot burn. It's not as tasty as I'd like but overall it's good and I'll order it again.

It's a durable construction, there is enough space for the 54 cups it says it can hold and the product looks great next to my Keurig coffee maker.<br /><br />I ended up buying this design drawer as I think the carousels use up too much space for the number of pods they can hold, and after reading reviews for drawers to put underneath coffee makers I figured that with a drawer underneath my coffee maker there wouldn't be enough space left between the top of my coffee maker and the cupboard to be able to lift the top of the coffee maker open to put new cups in.

5,"Fantastic flavor, great value","On the strength of the reviews for this, I decided to give Ambrosia Honey a shot. It's a gamble buying honey, having never tasted it.<br /><br />Luckily, this honey exceeded my expectations. I normally buy locally-produced honey at twice the cost. The depth of flavor is much better with this honey. It's hard to describe, but the flavor is both complex and light. If you're used to cheap grocery store honey, Ambrosia Honey will be a real treat.<br /><br />The price for this 4-pack is what pushes this honey to five-stars.

I've used so many different face washes in the past, from Jack's to, Niveas, to Adidas, Old Spice and all of them caused me to break out on my face.<br /><br />Only this product does not cause me to get more pimples.  Yes it does dry my face out a little (but every face wash does that).  To remedy that, I put lotion on my face after I shower.  HOwever, after about 2-3 weeks of putting lotion on, I started to break out again so I took a 1 week break from putting on lotion and my skin was clear again.<br /><br />Anyways...<br /><br />Basically, if your body chemistry is anything like mine, this will make your pimples disappear.<br /><br />It also smells really good - not too overpowering so that it'll mess with any cologne I put on.

5,Simply Wonderful,"I'm the first American born into my mother's UK family, so when I say that I was raised on tea, I am not exaggerating. The thing is, unlike coffee, I never have sugar with my tea - just a little bit of milk...drinking it this way makes me more aware of the subtle differences between tea brands and ""flavors.""<br /><br />Even with all the herbal teas available, Earl Grey will always be my favorite tea. The Higgins & Burke Earl Grey has just the right amount of bergamot. When I opened the individual foil-wrapped bag, the orange aroma hit me first...not overpowering, but rather inviting. This was a surprise because I've had some Earl Greys that had so much bergamot, I couldn't detect any other aromas.<br /><br />The taste is very smooth, and I've enjoyed every cup, but the real test was with my mother. She's always complained that many Earl Grey teas at our local store are so weak that she has to saok more than one bag per cup, but she loved Higgins & Burke!!",Positive,im first american born mother uk family say raised tea exaggerating thing unlike coffee never sugar tea little bit milkdrinking way make aware subtle difference tea brand flavorseven herbal tea available earl grey always favorite tea higgins burke earl grey right amount bergamot opened individual foilwrapped bag orange aroma hit firstnot overpowering rather inviting surprise ive earl grey much bergamot couldnt detect aromasthe taste smooth ive enjoyed every cup real test mother shes always complained many earl grey tea local store weak saok one bag per cup loved higgins burke
5,Delicious spread that has the power to transform most sandwiches into a real gourmet treat,"Skillet is the name a popular Seattle area food truck owned and operated by Culinary Institute of America trained chef, Joshua Henderson.  After working at a variety of top restaurants (including a stint as Head Chef at Beverly Hill's Avalon), Josh moved back to Seattle, bought a 1962 Airstream trailer and now serves gourmet food out of it to Seattle's night-time crowd.<br /><br />Skillet's signature item is simply called ""The Burger"" and what really sets it apart from other deluxe, $12 hamburgers is a generous slathering of Henderson's own creation, Bacon Jam.  When I first encountered this product I was so blown away by it's heavenly, bacon-rich flavor that I rushed to my computer to find out how it is made.  This is from Skillet's website: ""... we take a big bunch of really, really good bacon, and render it down...add a bunch of spices..onions, etc. and let it simmer for about 6 hours...give it a quick puree, blast chill it...and you have bacon jam...""<br /><br />This stuff is great!  It has a thick, spreadable consistency with hints of powdered chilies, brown sugar and vinegar.  It gives a somewhat subtle but unmistakable bacon taste to whatever you spread it on.  Hamburgers are a natural, but I have used it on paninis, grilled cheese sandwiches and a baked potato.  This will be a regular item in my house.  I should be able to use Bacon Jam for things other than sandwiches and I look forward to experimenting with this wonderful spread.",Positive,skillet name popular seattle area food truck owned operated culinary institute america trained chef joshua henderson working variety top restaurant including stint head chef beverly hill avalon josh moved back seattle bought airstream trailer serf gourmet food seattle nighttime crowdskillets signature item simply called burger really set apart deluxe hamburger generous slathering hendersons creation bacon jam first encountered product blown away heavenly baconrich flavor rushed computer find made skillet website take big bunch really really good bacon render downadd bunch spicesonions etc let simmer hoursgive quick puree blast chill itand bacon jamthis stuff great thick spreadable consistency hint powdered chilies brown sugar vinegar give somewhat subtle unmistakable bacon taste whatever spread hamburger natural used panini grilled cheese sandwich baked potato regular item house able use bacon jam thing sandwich look forward experimenting wonderful spread

5,Treats break into perfect pieces for my pup,"I bought these treats because they looked liked they could break into suitable pieces for my pup.  And they did.  Just by hand you could break it down to each leaf of the flower that the treat is shaped to be.  A 7oz bag comes with about 90 treats at ~9 calories each.  I usually break each one into 3 pieces (2 leaves each) and it's a good size for my 20lb pup.  After reading the ingredients, I was under the impression that they'd be kinda chewy but they're baked and hard/crunchy.  The pup takes about 8-10 seconds to finish each 2 leaf piece which is sometimes a little long when trying to train commands and etc but I just break the treats down even more if I need her to eat faster.  The flavor I bought, Pumpkin and Apple, smells great and they don't leave crumbles in my pocket when we're on the go.<br />One thing I should add though is that if you break the fruitables treats into pieces, you'll notice that they're pretty fibrous.  On several occasions my pup's had to cough/clear her throat after feeding her one of these.  But it's not a big deal she loves these treats.",Positive,bought treat looked liked could break suitable piece pup hand could break leaf flower treat shaped oz bag come treat calorie usually break one piece leaf good size lb pup reading ingredient impression theyd kinda chewy theyre baked hardcrunchy pup take second finish leaf piece sometimes little long trying train command etc break treat even need eat faster flavor bought pumpkin apple smell great dont leave crumbles pocket goone thing add though break fruitables treat piece youll notice theyre pretty fibrous several occasion pup coughclear throat feeding one big deal love treat

5,Too much of a good thing--not complaining though,"These things grow like crazy.  I planted my gardens (one gourmet herbs, one holiday herbs) three months ago and I have trouble keeping up with the amount of growth.  I use a lot of parsley and thyme so I'm delighted there is so much, but the excess of some of the others is going to the freezer. . . more chervil than I've ever seen.  The plants are healthy and clean with no bugs like outside gardens.  What a blessing.<br /><br />Yes, the lights are the very white daylight bulbs, but in my den, it adds nice lighting where I wouldn't otherwise have any and I rarely use the overhead light anymore so the electricity is a wash for me.  The pump in one garden made noise at first, but I read the FAQs on the website, which said it was likely that nutrients had gotten into the pump.  I jiggled the pump a bit and the problem went away.  Since then I put the nutrients at the front of the water well and have had no further problems.  Some people complain about the dripping sound but if you keep the water level up you don't hear it.<br /><br />I tried for years to grow fresh herbs indoors during the winter and was never really successful until now.  The units are very easy to care for and you can't beat the prolific harvest.  Now, if only they'd let me choose the individual herbs to grow instead of offering just the combination sets.  I may have to try planting my own seeds as they have kits that allow you to do that.  I'm looking forward to free salads all summer when it comes time to replant. Great product.",Positive,thing grow like crazy planted garden one gourmet herb one holiday herb three month ago trouble keeping amount growth use lot parsley thyme im delighted much excess others going freezer chervil ive ever seen plant healthy clean bug like outside garden blessingyes light white daylight bulb den add nice lighting wouldnt otherwise rarely use overhead light anymore electricity wash pump one garden made noise first read faq website said likely nutrient gotten pump jiggled pump bit problem went away since put nutrient front water well problem people complain dripping sound keep water level dont hear iti tried year grow fresh herb indoors winter never really successful unit easy care cant beat prolific harvest theyd let choose individual herb grow instead offering combination set may try planting seed kit allow im looking forward free salad summer come time replant great product

The thai is really good, but they aren't that much different than barbecue chips with a sprinkle of ginger flavor.  But the Buffalo Bleu IS AWESOME!  These are the absolutely best chips I have ever eaten.  The funny thing is that the bleu's were the ones that I thought I would probably regret getting.  They are awesome.  I will buy again.  And again.  And again.<br /><br />I would suggest, though, if you get them to get the smallest bag size or else you will do what my family and I have done:  finish a bag every other day.

It is smooth and has a light flavor. It is sweet enough that you don't need any extra sugar and I like to add just a dash of cream, too. There is no such thing as real ""white chocolate"" so people who are expecting a heavy chocolate flavor might do best to stick with the regular brown stuff.

5,Techno-BEST,"My disclaimer- I'm a coffee geek.  There's a few precursors to this Keurig brew basket, including what Keurig sells at Costco with the machine.  The advantages to all of them is getting the coffee you want, getting it at less than 1/2 the price and saving the planet with less waste. Most people just want the convenience of buying and throwing away the K-Cup, so all of these options are for a limited audience. Where the EkoBrew shines is cup quality- more coffee in the cup.  This comes from really nice saturation of the coffee because of the cone shaped water dispersion.  It's easy to hold and get out of the machine.  The puck comes out clean without digging out crevices as an earlier.  This is the first one I've seen with a rubber O-ring that seals the cup shut.  Ingenious.

3,Our dogs love it but finding low price and 12 oz cans is tough,"When Amazon LLC was selling large cans it was affordable via super saving shipping.  You expect a price reduction when buying large size cans.  One quarter of these cans was only partially filled with chunks, having an inch of fluid before touching the meat product.  I shake each of these large cans before opening one.  We prefer the smaller cans of this product, but local chains do not carry it in either size, and Amazon only offers it in large.  Our dogs love the pedigree brand pouches and cans, especially the beef and liver.  Although, they use corn product (one reviewer noted) and my veterinarian espouses ""...it's mostly water,"" our dogs vote is positive.  We treat our pets and give this to them because they like it...not for their health.<br /><br />After finding the substantial price increase this morning, I found the small cans at PetCo.

5,Best Dog Food Ever,"This is a great dog food product - healthy, organic and great for sensitive tummies!<br /><br />Our Lhasa Apso is nine years old, is a picky eater and has a very sensitive stomach. We started feeding him Newman's Own Organics dog food about 4 years ago and are really, really satified with this product. He rarely gets sick, eats almost every meal we give him, though sometimes he makes us wait for him to finish his breakfast but that's okay! With other dog food products he would stop eating them completely or get sick frequently - even the expensive brands we tried from the animal hospital.<br /><br />At first the only place we could buy Newman's Own was from a local, privately owned pet store which was very expensive but worth it since he stopped getting sick so frequently. I was delighted to buy it on Amazon. The price for the 12.5 lb bag is slightly more than what we were paying for the 7 lb bag locally. I am a Prime member so was able to get this without paying for shipping. I will certainly order it again when we get close to running out.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon!!",Positive,great dog food product healthy organic great sensitive tummiesour lhasa apso nine year old picky eater sensitive stomach started feeding newman organic dog food year ago really really satified product rarely get sick eats almost every meal give though sometimes make u wait finish breakfast thats okay dog food product would stop eating completely get sick frequently even expensive brand tried animal hospitalat first place could buy newman local privately owned pet store expensive worth since stopped getting sick frequently delighted buy amazon price lb bag slightly paying lb bag locally prime member able get without paying shipping certainly order get close running outthank amazon

5,Absolute awesome,"I eat these plain, an ounce at a time, to get my salty-crunchy fix while on WeightWatchers. I think they're pretty darn healthy, and pretty unique. It's not drowning in salt, just enough sea salt to bring out the natural flavors.

4,"Didn't know exactly what to expect, turned out better.","The first reason why I had even purchased this drink was because of a friend, of a friend, I saw their post on a blog telling people how this drink was ""so good and refreshing,"" that I, myself, wanted to give it a try. They say that you'll never know if something is good or not, till you try for yourself.<br /><br />Amazon took awhile to ship and it was delivered on a day I didn't expect it to, so that worked out nicely. Packing of the drinks was questionable, but I've bought things from Amazon before so that was no real big deal to me. So that was 1 Star.<br /><br />When I first took a sip, I noticed a difference it had from many other ""energy"" drinks I've had before. Lightly carbonated, is a big understatement to me. It felt more like a juice that would always be cold, because the way it has been carbonated made it feel that way. So I don't really consider it to be an energy drink at all. 2 Stars there, tasted better than expected and for 12 bottles, it is a bit pricey but to me, not a big deal considering if this is what I'm paying for, then I'll stop with those other cruddy drinks for these.<br /><br />The last star, over the period of maybe 2 weeks I had finished all 12 bottles and gave some to my younger siblings to try. None of them told me of anything described on the label to have happened to them, but they loved the taste of it. In my opinion, Bliss has the best taste so far and I have tried Sonic as well, and I wouldn't recommend that one. Maybe after the first few days or so, I did notice feeling calmer, energy-wise I did feel like I had more energy to do things that I wanted to around the house and at school. But not by a lot.<br /><br />Reason for not giving that last star. The drink is good, better than I had expected to be, and the price of $2.50 per drink isn't so bad at all. This is considering that most energy drinks now cost in the range of $1.25 to $2.25. So for a little extra, you get something better and isn't hidden in a can where you can't see what is actually in there, plus tastes great.<br /><br />Recently I've just purchased Neuro Sun and Neuro Sleep, so I'll probably end up writing reviews for both of those as well.<br /><br />All in all, Neuro Bliss, in my opinion, definitely is worth the money. But don't go into buying this drink expecting too much out of it, that way when you do try it, it'll end up being better than you what you could have expected it to be. Maybe it'll even surprise you.",Positive,first reason even purchased drink friend friend saw post blog telling people drink good refreshing wanted give try say youll never know something good till try yourselfamazon took awhile ship delivered day didnt expect worked nicely packing drink questionable ive bought thing amazon real big deal starwhen first took sip noticed difference many energy drink ive lightly carbonated big understatement felt like juice would always cold way carbonated made feel way dont really consider energy drink star tasted better expected bottle bit pricey big deal considering im paying ill stop cruddy drink thesethe last star period maybe week finished bottle gave younger sibling try none told anything described label happened loved taste opinion bliss best taste far tried sonic well wouldnt recommend one maybe first day notice feeling calmer energywise feel like energy thing wanted around house school lotreason giving last star drink good better expected price per drink isnt bad considering energy drink cost range little extra get something better isnt hidden cant see actually plus taste greatrecently ive purchased neuro sun neuro sleep ill probably end writing review wellall neuro bliss opinion definitely worth money dont go buying drink expecting much way try itll end better could expected maybe itll even surprise

5,Convenience and a competitive price,"I get tire of running to the store to get supplies for my cats, especially since I live 20 miles away from the nearest Walmart and sometimes the winters are not the best. I did a lot of looking around for cat food that I could have delivered that would be appropriate for my cats, and either the same price as it would be at the store (or hopefully cheaper). I am spending the same amount of money that I was before, only I don't have to worry about running out and having to buy an overpriced bag of cat food (often not the brand we normally use) at the grocery store in my small town due to bad roads keeping me from running to Walmart. Both cats love the food, and beg for it when their bowl is empty.  I like knowing that I won't run out so easily , and have the convenience of having it delivered to me.  I did the same with cat treats (subscribe and save), now if only I could find kitty litter that I prefer to use that was affordable to have shipped, but no luck there so far. I keep hoping that Amazon will get more subscribe and save products. I check often (crossing my fingers for the kitty litter that I normally use to show up at a good subscribe and save price)",Positive,get tire running store get supply cat especially since live mile away nearest walmart sometimes winter best lot looking around cat food could delivered would appropriate cat either price would store hopefully cheaper spending amount money dont worry running buy overpriced bag cat food often brand normally use grocery store small town due bad road keeping running walmart cat love food beg bowl empty like knowing wont run easily convenience delivered cat treat subscribe save could find kitty litter prefer use affordable shipped luck far keep hoping amazon get subscribe save product check often crossing finger kitty litter normally use show good subscribe save price

5,Best packaged candy ever made.,"I agree with the other reviewer in that the large candy companies just can't compete when it comes to one thing: quality.  How would they?  They're in the business of mass production.  That's why this small-town, small-batch-made candy is the best you'll ever taste out of a package.  It makes the other candy companies pale in comparison.  Being from Ohio, I also grew up on Mallo cups but found it hard to find in DC/Northern Virginia, though it's at some Mom and Pop convenient marts in the country.  Still, now that I can purchase online, I plan to dole it out to friends and family to get them hooked and then tell them how to order themselves so that this company never goes out of business.  At least not if I can help it.  You won't regret trying this product if you never have.",Positive,agree reviewer large candy company cant compete come one thing quality would theyre business mass production thats smalltown smallbatchmade candy best youll ever taste package make candy company pale comparison ohio also grew mallo cup found hard find dcnorthern virginia though mom pop convenient mart country still purchase online plan dole friend family get hooked tell order company never go business least help wont regret trying product never

5,Most unusual banana soda,"I ordered this item with hesitation. My daughters both love everything to do with bananas so much i decided to order it for the new year. I was pleasantly surprised. The shipping was fast and the items were packed excellently! I ordered 3 bottles of banana and 3 of watermelon soda. My total shipping was just over $8 because of ordering a higher quantity of these sodas. They both tasted great! Very light on flavor, not overpowering or heavily fake, but very nice and lightly sweet. They were great! The items were so securely packed it would have taken a lot to damage them. I was very well pleased. AND THE BOTTLES!! These were the most unusual glass soda bottles I have ever seen. The top plastic piece comes off and reveals a plastic break off tool to use to open the bottle which is sealed by a glass bead. You push the tool onto the  bead and it pops inside the bottle and is securely kept inside the upper portion of the bottle. The experience of opening these sodas was as enjoyable as drinking them. I will purchase them again!!",Positive,ordered item hesitation daughter love everything banana much decided order new year pleasantly surprised shipping fast item packed excellently ordered bottle banana watermelon soda total shipping ordering higher quantity soda tasted great light flavor overpowering heavily fake nice lightly sweet great item securely packed would taken lot damage well pleased bottle unusual glass soda bottle ever seen top plastic piece come reveals plastic break tool use open bottle sealed glass bead push tool onto bead pop inside bottle securely kept inside upper portion bottle experience opening soda enjoyable drinking purchase
5,A Favorite Snack!,"I have been consuming these coconut bars for several months now after having purchased a small box at HomeGoods. These bars are delicious! They taste like the inside of a Mounds Bar. Only 2 ingredients: shredded coconut & rice syrup. I have purchased the 20 pack box through Amazon a few times. One of the latest boxes contained bars that tasted odd. They were darker in color and did not have the fresh coconut taste I was used to. Perhaps they were in a delivery truck that was hot and the oil in the coconut started to go rancid? Anyway, I contacted the company (Oskri) and their quality department was great. They provided a return shipping label for the unconsumed bars and shipped out a brand new box of 20 bars plus some additional samples to try. I have read some other reviewers that said they didn't like the taste of the bars. It's too bad they didn't try to contact the company because I'm sure they would have sent out a replacement product. I did notice though that the nutrition information has changed even though the weight & contents of the bar are the same. The calories, fat & sugar have all increased (180 cals vs. 246 cals, 11 grams vs. 14 grams, 14 grams vs. 29 grams). That is unfortunate, and I will have to cut down on my consumption. However, these bars really do taste yummy! They are soft, chewy, sweet & fresh.

5,Great stuff,"Well, what can I say. It's oregano and it's a lot of it. I think I'll die of old age before I consume this whole thing. The weight looks like this isn't too much, but it's dried leaves, very light. Oregano is supposed to be very high in antioxidants, so there you have it. I have to say that all these health-related rules of thumbs are confusing, and you can find reports claiming directly opposite things, for example, isolated antioxidants (pills, basically) don't seem to do squat in humans (in petri dishes they do work). But when consumed as food they seem to work, and oregano is very rich in this stuff. And, all else aside, it tastes great, so this option here is clearly recommended, at least because it's cheaper than buying small jars in stores. I'm very satisfied with this product, and I will gladly reorder (assuming I live long enough to need a refill!).",Positive,well say oregano lot think ill die old age consume whole thing weight look like isnt much dried leaf light oregano supposed high antioxidant say healthrelated rule thumb confusing find report claiming directly opposite thing example isolated antioxidant pill basically dont seem squat human petri dish work consumed food seem work oregano rich stuff else aside taste great option clearly recommended least cheaper buying small jar store im satisfied product gladly reorder assuming live long enough need refill

1,A nighmare dealing with this company,"Folks, move along--don't buy this from these people.  They are completely incompetent.<br /><br />As an example, here's how they dealt w/my order 2 weeks ago:<br /><br />1 Waited a WEEK, then called me 6 TIMES, harassing me in the middle of a work meeting.<br />2 No one should EVER ship food 2nd day on Wednesdays--most food companies realize this.  If the shipper does make a mistake, the food is sitting in a warehouse somewhere, rotting.  These people actually WAIT A WEEK AND A HALF, then ship on Wednesdays!  Then they try to blame the shippers for their own inccompetence!<br />3. The owner of this company then, after all the fiasco discussed above, send a nasty email, complaining about my rudeness (yeah, why don't we call him 6 times in a row, during some inconvenient time).  He also blamed the shipping being late on FedEx (um, if you shipped on Tuesday or Monday, this doesn't happen)<br />4. Finally, he tried to claim they had upgraded me for shipping on 2nd day air, when the shipping was FREE for orders over 80 dollats.<br /><br />All in all, this is a really bad company.  If you want headaches, then please feel free and order from these people.<br /><br />My advice?  Order from D'Artagnans--I've dealt with them many times and they are considerate, acknowledge mistakes and at least attemt to rectify mistakes, instead of denying any fault at all.<br /><br />One last thing to sum this up--I ordered A WEEK LATER from Thai Food here on Amazon.

5,Truly strangely addictive,"I discovered these in a local health food store when I began searching for seaweed products as a way to add some iodine to my diet.

Then I found SeaSnax which use olive oil!<br /><br />I bought some and the rest was history. Now I buy them in bulk from amazon because the price is much better. Yes, they do have a slightly fishy odor and flavor - but I *like* that. You may not like them as much as I do if that bothers you. But for me they are the perfect snack - great taste, a nice crunchy mouth-feel, low in carbs and calories. No matter what your eating goals or eating style - low carb, low cal, low fat, vegan, etc. these snacks can fill the bill, but you *must* like that slightly fishy taste and scent. However in my case I do!<br /><br />I eat these so often that it's great amazon has them in bulk like this, although my most recent purchase was a 6-pack and not a 12 as I wanted to buy ALL the flavors, not just the plain, so I bought 6-packs of them all.

5,Nothing else like it!,"I've tried just about every flavor out there that i can find of Izze Sparkling soda and I've loved every sip of it. Izze is a wonderful combination of juice and sparkling water. The blackberry flavor is a blend of grape, apple, lemon, raspberry and, of course, blackberry. The mixture together seems to taste as much like blackberry as popping a fresh punch of blackberries into your mouth.<br /><br />The sweetness is the natural sweetness of fruit, and there is nothing added to make it artificial tasting. This is a super substitute for ordinary sodas. It's a much healthier choice!<br /><br />Very highly recommended!",Positive,ive tried every flavor find izze sparkling soda ive loved every sip izze wonderful combination juice sparkling water blackberry flavor blend grape apple lemon raspberry course blackberry mixture together seems taste much like blackberry popping fresh punch blackberry mouththe sweetness natural sweetness fruit nothing added make artificial tasting super substitute ordinary soda much healthier choicevery highly recommended

4,Not a bad selection.,"This set comes with four different coffees.  Here's my feedback on each.<br /><br />Green Mountain Nantucket Blend: This is probably the best of the bunch.  Just an all around good coffee without being overly rich or laced with any extra flavors.  It smells great and tastes smooth.<br /><br />Newman's Own Organics Special Blend: This is my second favorite.  Paul may be known for his salad dressing, but he also makes a good cuppa.<br /><br />Caribou Blend: No complaints, but it's nothing special.  Just a regular run of the mill coffee.<br /><br />Tully's French Roast: This is my least favorite of the bunch.  The coffee seems a bit watery and bland.  I never have been a fan of French roast so that may weigh in on my opinion.<br /><br />Overall this is a good collection of K-cups for your morning coffee fix.  Perfect for someone who doesn't want any flavored or frilly coffee, just a straight up good cup of Joe.",Positive,set come four different coffee here feedback eachgreen mountain nantucket blend probably best bunch around good coffee without overly rich laced extra flavor smell great taste smoothnewmans organic special blend second favorite paul may known salad dressing also make good cuppacaribou blend complaint nothing special regular run mill coffeetullys french roast least favorite bunch coffee seems bit watery bland never fan french roast may weigh opinionoverall good collection kcups morning coffee fix perfect someone doesnt want flavored frilly coffee straight good cup joe

They're made with whole grains, including quinoa, one of the healthiest grains out there. The flax seeds are an excellent way to get important omega-3 fatty acids into your system.They're also a very good source of fiber. Best of all, they're made with all-natural ingredients.<br /><br />Besides being good for your diet, these crunchy clusters are addictively good--both by themselves and as a yogurt topping. I wasn't sure how'd they would actually taste, as I've had plenty of bland health foods.

5,"Delicious , Nice soft texture","I really was expecting some nearly straw-like hard thing. I was expecting NOT to like it.<br /><br />Much to my surprise, it was actually very good with quite a few nice flavors-coconut, chocolate, oats, etc. that all came together well.  (And I'm like Mikey on the old Life cereal commercials-I don't like these things usually.)  But, I was looking for something tolerable to eat on the run or at the desk. It certainly is tastier than that.<br /><br />The nutritional analysis is pretty good.  At 180 calories and  9 grams of fat, it probably is most appropriate as a snack substitute, commuter or travel tidbit, or as a meal component with your tea, coffee, milk & fruit. If you're hungry & want something good, healthy, and quickly, this is a good choice.<br /><br />No trans fat, but be aware it is not low-fat.  No Vitamin C, minimal calcium but a good source of fiber and whole grain.  Good source of Omega 3 Fatty acids, low source of protein (2 g).<br /><br />So enjoy it as a healthy, tasty source of fiber and Omega 3 Fatty Acids, but you should look elsewhere in your diet for protein, Vitamin C, Calcium-not significantly fortified there.<br /><br />But, hey, it's much better than a standard cookie and tastes just as good or better!",Positive,really expecting nearly strawlike hard thing expecting like itmuch surprise actually good quite nice flavorscoconut chocolate oat etc came together well im like mikey old life cereal commercialsi dont like thing usually looking something tolerable eat run desk certainly tastier thatthe nutritional analysis pretty good calorie gram fat probably appropriate snack substitute commuter travel tidbit meal component tea coffee milk fruit youre hungry want something good healthy quickly good choiceno trans fat aware lowfat vitamin c minimal calcium good source fiber whole grain good source omega fatty acid low source protein gso enjoy healthy tasty source fiber omega fatty acid look elsewhere diet protein vitamin c calciumnot significantly fortified therebut hey much better standard cookie taste good better

5,Great Chip!,"With Kettle Chips, you really have to be careful.  Some of their flavors are nauseating.  With that said, they DO make fantastic plain chips.  Thick cuts of potato, fried to a dark golden brown.  They are crunchy and lightly salted with sea salt.  I can't recommend these chips enough.  You won't regret it.<br /><br />Some people say they are burnt but they aren't.  From their website: ""Take a quick look and you'll see an immediate difference: Kettle Brand® Potato Chips are a beautiful tawny gold. During cooking, the natural sugars of our select potatoes caramelize, creating chips from light gold to a deep amber.  The results are flavors as deep and rich as the colors, and an artisanal display in every bag""<br /><br />Some have also said that these chips are oily, which is true.  But they explain that on their website: ""At Kettle Foods we exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower and/or safflower oil to make Kettle Brand®  products. Both of these oils are naturally free of trans fatty acids and are not hydrogenated in any way. We have taken the extra step of sending our products to independent third party labs to test for the presence of trans fats and results indicate we are ""trans fat free"" meaning none were detected. You will see zero trans fats listed on our packaging.""  That oiliness is natural and happens when quality oil is being used.<br /><br />You will not find chips with such a natural potato flavor.  I'm also a fan of their unsalted potato chips.  For those of us watching our salt intake, the unsalted chips is the best you can get.  Period.",Positive,kettle chip really careful flavor nauseating said make fantastic plain chip thick cut potato fried dark golden brown crunchy lightly salted sea salt cant recommend chip enough wont regret itsome people say burnt arent website take quick look youll see immediate difference kettle brand potato chip beautiful tawny gold cooking natural sugar select potato caramelize creating chip light gold deep amber result flavor deep rich color artisanal display every bagsome also said chip oily true explain website kettle food exclusively use expeller pressed high monounsaturated sunflower andor safflower oil make kettle brand product oil naturally free trans fatty acid hydrogenated way taken extra step sending product independent third party lab test presence trans fat result indicate trans fat free meaning none detected see zero trans fat listed packaging oiliness natural happens quality oil usedyou find chip natural potato flavor im also fan unsalted potato chip u watching salt intake unsalted chip best get period

4,My 12-year old son LOVES this stuff.,"I don't think it looks or smells particularly appealing, and I have not tasted it. My son, however, thinks it's darn near the best stuff in the world.<br /><br />After he had some at a friend's house and came home raving about it, I (reluctantly) bought a box for his use as an after-school snack. According to him, it's the kind of quick food that staves off after-school hunger so severe that it will actually kill a 12-year old boy if he doesn't counteract it by eating something the second he arrives home. (After all, dinner is still a couple hours away; FAR too long to save a hungry, growing boy from complete starvation.)<br /><br />At his request, I bought him a box of Cheeseburger Mac Hamburger Helper Microwave Singles at our local grocery store. A few weeks later I went back, intending to purchase more. Unfortunately, they were out. I asked a store clerk when they would have it back in stock and was told that *that* product would no longer be carried. None of the flavors. We have two grocery stores in our town; I checked the other grocery store with the same result.<br /><br />Odd. Unfortunate. I suspect that this may prove to be one of those products that just don't make it, for some reason.<br /><br />Too bad. It's great kid-quick food, food that they can make themselves, food they will eat and not toy with before tossing away, and food that actually has a modicum of food value to it instead of a load of completely empty calories.<br /><br />So I'm going online to buy up a bunch of this product before disappears completely.",Positive,dont think look smell particularly appealing tasted son however think darn near best stuff worldafter friend house came home raving reluctantly bought box use afterschool snack according kind quick food stave afterschool hunger severe actually kill year old boy doesnt counteract eating something second arrives home dinner still couple hour away far long save hungry growing boy complete starvationat request bought box cheeseburger mac hamburger helper microwave single local grocery store week later went back intending purchase unfortunately asked store clerk would back stock told product would longer carried none flavor two grocery store town checked grocery store resultodd unfortunate suspect may prove one product dont make reasontoo bad great kidquick food food make food eat toy tossing away food actually modicum food value instead load completely empty caloriesso im going online buy bunch product disappears completely

I had a 4 tiered anniversary cake to do in ivory.  I HATE coloring fondant so I figured this was as good a time as any to try a new fondant that was already colored so I ordered Satin Ice (...or SATAN Ice as I now call it).  I took it out of the tub and set it on the counter.  My 9 year old twins both said WHAT is that?!  I said ""It's fondant!""  Having seen me work with fondant for many years, they both said ""It looks too GOOEY to be fondant!!"".  Boy... even at 9 they are VERY observant.  It was very easy to roll out, but getting it ON the cake was a different story.  When I picked it up to put it on the cake it fell apart in my hands.  I attempted this 4 times.  Finally I put wax paper underneath it, rolled it out and flipped it onto the cake.  Easy enough.....or so I thought until I saw all the wrinkles transferred from the wax paper...back to the drawing board.  I ended up putting wax paper underneath, rolling it out, putting wax paper on top, flipping it over, THEN putting it on the cake....only to find that it still tore in the process.  UGH.

But at the same time, doublemint actually makes your breath smell just as great.  Isn't that wonderful?  Wrigley's Doublement gum is certainly for me.  A 15-stick gum pack would keep your minty fresh breath going strong for several weeks (unless you have a gum chewing addiction... then it'd be gone in a few days).

It's also not cloying in sweetness, which I find off-putting in some granola. It contains some pieces big enough to snack on but it's also lovely with milk.  However, the red berries are almost non-existent.  I've eaten half the bag already and only gotten 3 measly pieces of spongy strawberry that were smaller than green peas. I can barely taste it.  For almost $4 a bag, I expect to see red berries when the package says red berries.

5,Lovely mint tea!,"I ended up choosing this from the numerous mint tea options available on amazon because I'd tried Revolution's Earl Grey before and loved it. This stuff is just fantastic! First of all, it comes in a tetrahedral teabag, as opposed to a flat one. The bag is made out of a sort of nylon-type mesh instead of paper, so you don't get any weird paper taste (it matters more in the more delicate herbal teas than the darker black teas, for me anyway). Secondly, inside the tea bag, you get actual mint leaves, not tiny flakes and dust. And because the tea bag has a more 3-dimensional shape, the leaves don't get crushed as much either. The flavor is absolutely delightful! It's very smooth and aromatic, no bitterness or anything unpleasant at all. Great night time tea or anytime relaxing tea! If you don't like your tea very strong, you can use one tea bag to infuse two cups. Also, if you're not that into hot tea, this tastes pretty good cold as well, especially if you add a little sugar. Very reasonably priced high quality tea and probably about the best you can do without going loose leaf. Will definitely keep buying this!",Positive,ended choosing numerous mint tea option available amazon id tried revolution earl grey loved stuff fantastic first come tetrahedral teabag opposed flat one bag made sort nylontype mesh instead paper dont get weird paper taste matter delicate herbal tea darker black tea anyway secondly inside tea bag get actual mint leaf tiny flake dust tea bag dimensional shape leaf dont get crushed much either flavor absolutely delightful smooth aromatic bitterness anything unpleasant great night time tea anytime relaxing tea dont like tea strong use one tea bag infuse two cup also youre hot tea taste pretty good cold well especially add little sugar reasonably priced high quality tea probably best without going loose leaf definitely keep buying

I haven't been there in a long time and I asked my friend what he would reccommend on the menu.  He said to get a pastrami sandwich and the cel-ray soda.  I thought to myself, cel-ray soda, yuck as I am not a big soda drinker to begin with and this did not sound too appetizing.  I ordered the Woody Allen which was pastrami and corned beef on rye with cel-ray soda.  The sandwich was huge, only ate half.  The cel-ray soda was simply amazing, a slight hint of celery in a light refreshing drink.  When I got home back to upstate New York, I began to try to find this amazing soda in my area.  I googled it to see who would carry it in my area and it said select Wegmans stores carry it.  I have 5 Wegmans in my area and not one carries it.

1,Don't waste your money or your Keurig on this!,"This coffee tastes very flavorful and is not too strong, but I have to say it almost ruined my months' old Keurig Personal Brewer. The coffee is ground so finely that when the K-Cups are punctured by the needles (top and bottom), it gets packed into the needles and also sifts out through the holes made by the needles, going into the coffee cup creating a very nasty ""sludge"" in the bottom of each cup. I purchased a pack of 2 (48 K-Cups) and didn't even use one full pack. I do not recommend this brand or blend. It is a waste of money, which is something I couldn't really afford at this time.

5,Best Winter Breakfast,"I found this in my pantry while looking for the Fruit 'n Cream Quaker Instant Oatmeal we usually eat (I like the peaches and cream flavor), and I gave it a shot.  It was so good!  The instructions made it so easy... Basically, the  oatmeal comes in an oblong pouch (paper-feel), you rip it open, dump it into a bowl, fill the pouch with water, pour it over the oatmeal, pop it in the microwave for a couple of minutes.  And tada, hot and delicious breakfast!<br /><br />I usually have a large breakfast, so I use two pouches at once--double oatmeal, double water, put it in the microwave for 3:30 minutes.  I mix in a teaspoon of honey, and it's just right for me with a mug of hot tea.  I've been sick the past few days, and most food has not sat well with me, but this oatmeal has been very easy on the tummy.  Also, it's whole-grain and has flax seeds in it, which adds more fiber to your diet and helps digestion.<br /><br />My only mystery was where it came from.  I assumed it must have been from the local Whole Foods, but they didn't carry it when I asked.  It turns out it was from Target, and my MIL put it in a care package she sent us!  Sometimes mother knows best, I guess. :)<br /><br />The package is kind of small though.  It's compact and a space saver in the pantry, but for someone like me, who goes through oatmeal fast, I wish it were bigger.  I'd be happy if Amazon sold it as subscribe & save with free shipping, as I'd love to buy it in bulk (at least 20ish packets at a time).",Positive,found pantry looking fruit n cream quaker instant oatmeal usually eat like peach cream flavor gave shot good instruction made easy basically oatmeal come oblong pouch paperfeel rip open dump bowl fill pouch water pour oatmeal pop microwave couple minute tada hot delicious breakfasti usually large breakfast use two pouch oncedouble oatmeal double water put microwave minute mix teaspoon honey right mug hot tea ive sick past day food sat well oatmeal easy tummy also wholegrain flax seed add fiber diet help digestionmy mystery came assumed must local whole food didnt carry asked turn target mil put care package sent u sometimes mother know best guess package kind small though compact space saver pantry someone like go oatmeal fast wish bigger id happy amazon sold subscribe save free shipping id love buy bulk least ish packet time
5,Best Chocolate Flavor by Far,"I'm a chocoholic and have tried every mocha, swiss almond chocolate, etc. coffee I've ever seen, k-cup and not k-cup.  This is the best.  It may actually be better than German chocolate cake--it's like a no-cal, fat-free dessert.  My favorite way to drink it right now is to throw in a packet of Splenda and a little bit of Organic Valley chocolate soy milk, though it's good without sweetener or creamer.  It's chocolaty, with a hint of coconut.  I highly recommend for anyone who likes coffee (it's not a weak coffee, like most of the flavored kcups I've tried).  Also, Amazon's price for Timothy's is the best I can find, subscribe and save price comes out to around $0.37 a cup.

5,Great tasting low fat peanut butter,"PB2 is a staple in my kitchen. I also keep a container at work to make quick and easy snacks. It's a powdered peanut butter - peanuts with most of the fat removed, plus small amounts of sugar and salt for flavor. The amount of sugar per 2 tablespoon serving is only 1 gram (equivalent to 1/4 of a teaspoon). I'm a dietitian and recommend this to my patients who need to follow low fat diets but don't want to give up peanut butter. My favorite way to eat this is with apple slices, although I've had patients tell me they like to dip their fresh fruit directly into the powder. Amazon seems to have the best prices for this item.",Positive,pb staple kitchen also keep container work make quick easy snack powdered peanut butter peanut fat removed plus small amount sugar salt flavor amount sugar per tablespoon serving gram equivalent teaspoon im dietitian recommend patient need follow low fat diet dont want give peanut butter favorite way eat apple slice although ive patient tell like dip fresh fruit directly powder amazon seems best price item

5,Will Work For Tea,"Another winner from Red Leaf Tea!<br /><br />The smell of the this particular matcha is tangy and slightly sweet, even though there's no sugar added to the flavoring.  I prepared this my usual way - cold latte style.  Two ounces of warmed water with a teaspoon of matcha and a half teaspoon of super-fine sugar - wisk until blended.  I didn't try sifting the matcha this time, and it frothed up very nicely without any clumping.  Six ounces of cold, creamy whole milk and the taste was so smooth and creamy with a bit of tang - just how I like my cheesecake to be!<br /><br />After my first cup as a cold latte, I went for a second cup  - this time as a warmed, straight matcha.  The tang and creaminess are much less noticable the second time around, but the matcha base is much more prevalent.  As the cup cools, the tangy taste comes to the forefront with the matcha and the creaminess lags behind.  It's kind of like having two very different teas, which is pretty awesome for just buying the one!  A creamy, dessert-like cup of tangy cheesecake with milk/dairy alternative or a green tea with a little tang - it's up to whatever kind of mood you're in!",Positive,another winner red leaf teathe smell particular matcha tangy slightly sweet even though there sugar added flavoring prepared usual way cold latte style two ounce warmed water teaspoon matcha half teaspoon superfine sugar wisk blended didnt try sifting matcha time frothed nicely without clumping six ounce cold creamy whole milk taste smooth creamy bit tang like cheesecake beafter first cup cold latte went second cup time warmed straight matcha tang creaminess much less noticable second time around matcha base much prevalent cup cool tangy taste come forefront matcha creaminess lag behind kind like two different tea pretty awesome buying one creamy dessertlike cup tangy cheesecake milkdairy alternative green tea little tang whatever kind mood youre
2,Better off using EVOO,"The first ingredient in this formulation is mineral oil - olive oil is the fourth. I was underwhelmed by the results of using this oil; a little goes a long way but it basically coats your hair.<br /><br />I don't consider mineral oil a ""nourishing"" property.

5,Love Kettle Chips,"These are a favorite at our home. We like the ones that have Sea Salt. We also like Barbeque  flavored. These are not ruffly chips that have ridges. These are thickly cut plain slice potatoes. They are thick and crunchy and have a great texture in your mouth. They also have a great taste.

5,Interesting blend,"My two teas of choice are green tea and earl grey.  Green tea goes great with meals, and early grey makes a nice morning or evening relaxing drink.  When I saw a package combing them both, I had to give it a try.<br /><br />And it is good.  The mixing of green and black teas has a unique flavor, and the oil of the rind of a bergamot orange gives it that distinct ""earl grey"" taste.  Overall, it tastes much more like the classic earl grey black tea, with those notes overpowering the green tea, but it does have a lighter flavor than pure earl grey.<br /><br />I don't know if this will be come a regular drink for me, but it was a pleasant surprise and one that I will pull out every now and then.  It would be a fantastic beverage for those seeking the health benefits of green tea but aren't particularly taken with the flavor.  It is also an organic tea, which is an added bonus in flavor, health and overall quality of product.",Positive,two tea choice green tea earl grey green tea go great meal early grey make nice morning evening relaxing drink saw package combing give tryand good mixing green black tea unique flavor oil rind bergamot orange give distinct earl grey taste overall taste much like classic earl grey black tea note overpowering green tea lighter flavor pure earl greyi dont know come regular drink pleasant surprise one pull every would fantastic beverage seeking health benefit green tea arent particularly taken flavor also organic tea added bonus flavor health overall quality product

5,Wow and YUM!,We LOVE this stuff around my house.  I finally got my husband to switch from his sugary sports drinks to a healthy option.  His favorite is the Pink Guava.  I like it because it has a ton of potassium and other minerals that hydrate me well which is important as I am a full time fitness instructor.  It also satisfies my sweet cravings without being sugary or doing crazy things to my blood sugar.  I'm sure kids will love it as well.  A much better option than a Sunny whatever juice box.  It is perfect for a packed lunch.  FIVE STARS! I'd give it more if I could.  The Mango flavor of this brand is also wonderful and the unflavored is a favorite as well.  I enjoy it more than other brands (and I've tried quite a few).  O.N.E. is by far my favorite.,Positive,love stuff around house finally got husband switch sugary sport drink healthy option favorite pink guava like ton potassium mineral hydrate well important full time fitness instructor also satisfies sweet craving without sugary crazy thing blood sugar im sure kid love well much better option sunny whatever juice box perfect packed lunch five star id give could mango flavor brand also wonderful unflavored favorite well enjoy brand ive tried quite one far favorite

I have been using Wellness products since both were puppies and specifically the Wellness Simple brand since I discovered the allergies.

4,Good Coffee for a Designer Coffee,"I have gradually come to realize good coffee doesn't have to bite your head off. People have been convinced that the more your socks curl, the better it is.

5,Finally a food that works!!!,"I have a 3 1/2 year old American Bulldog that has gone through thousands of dollars in vet bills and worthless speculations. She has been on Grandma Lucy's Rabbit Pureformance for several days now and I have already noticed the vast improvement in her demeanor and energy level. My dog used to violently scratch at herself till she made herself bleed. We discovered that she was allergic to beef, lamb, pork, chicken, and duck. Due to the simple yet nutritional ingredients of Grandma Lucy's she is doing excellent. It's been several days and NO MORE SCRATCHING...I am so excited that I had to write a review. My dog was so allergic to the many different other foods that we have tried with her that we almost lost all hope and we were going to just highly medicate her for the rest of her life. I didn't want to do that and after looking at the excellent ingredients contained in this brand of food I was hoping for the best. I couldn't be more happy and delighted! She's been on various raw, dry, wet, home cooked, and everything else with no luck. Please Grandma Lucy's never change your ingredients on the Rabbit Pureformance line of food because you have just made our lives a whole lot more stress free, thank you! Anyone with a dog that has bad allergies should really give this food a try...it might be the best decision you've ever made for your dog. I'd also like to add that the preparation for making her food is very simple. Just add warm water to the freeze dried food until you get the desired consistency that you prefer. Let it stand for a few minutes and then it is ready to serve. The food honestly smells amazing and at times I have thought about trying it myself. It's made with all human grade ingredients which is good to know. My dog Sadie is 75lbs and a 10lb bag of this fantastic product lasts us approximately 20 days.

The bottled version tastes much better.

Drink it ice cold though, otherwise it doesn't taste that great.<br /><br />Sugar is a bit high, with 120 calories per bottle. 70% juice.

5,Absolutely Wonderful!,"These have a delicate, nutty, warm, faintly sweet wheat flavor, and a pleasing texture.  Satisfying without guilt, they're truly addictive.  I prefer them to digestives (much less Graham crackers), and even Leibniz's standard butter biscuits don't come close.

4,Excellent Raw Cashews,"After shopping several places for more economical raw cashews than my local health food market, I decided on this item. They arrived quickly and are great nuts, however, my only complaint would be how they were packaged. Five pounds of cashews should be shipped in a proper box -- NOT a priority mail envelope!!

3,He likes it but...,"We have the pickiest dog on earth.  It took us 3 years to find a food that he would eat a full bowl of on a consistent basis!  When this came and we filled his bowl with it the first time, I fully expected him to possibly take a couple of bites then refuse to eat any more.  I was shocked when he ate the entire bowl then went to his food container, basicly asking for more.  I gave him another cup of the food, he ate most of that before he laid down again.  I was thrilled to find another food that he liked!<br />After 3 or 4 days of him eating this food, he started having REALLY bad gas.  Imagine a 100 lb dog with bad gas laying next to where you are sitting on the couch!  Nevermind, you don't want to imagine that but you get my point.  After 4 days of dealing with the gas from hell we put him back on his old food.  Viola, gas was gone!  Thank God!  I don't know if that's a common reaction to the food but it certainly didn't agree with our dog's tummy.  Good news is that the outside cats like it and if they have gas, too, I don't have to deal with it.  ;-)",Neutral,pickiest dog earth took u year find food would eat full bowl consistent basis came filled bowl first time fully expected possibly take couple bite refuse eat shocked ate entire bowl went food container basicly asking gave another cup food ate laid thrilled find another food likedafter day eating food started really bad gas imagine lb dog bad gas laying next sitting couch nevermind dont want imagine get point day dealing gas hell put back old food viola gas gone thank god dont know thats common reaction food certainly didnt agree dog tummy good news outside cat like gas dont deal

5,FoodDOESTasteGood Multigrain,"These tortilla chips should be renamed to FoodDoesTasteGood!  So many times ""healthy"" or ""good for you"" snacks are as flavorless as water.  Good for you, but absolutely boring to the taste buds.  These chips, however break the rules.  No Trans Fat, 0.5% staurated fat. 18g carb, 3g dietary fiber, 2g sugars and 3g protein with only 140 calories per 1 ounce bag w/60 of them from non saturated (good)fats.  Remember, not all fat is bad.  Some fat, like these are needed for digestion and brain function.  The flavor is great.  They are filled with flax seed, whole grains, wheat, but have a crisp, thick feel without grainy flavor.  They have a salty flavor like that of a tortilla, but you don't need a topping or salsa for the flavor.  No itchy lips from to much salt like a regular tortilla and no salsa falling on your clothes!  I eat these just as a quick snack but have served them along with hummus, cheese and veggie sticks for a crowd.  I also toss them into my kids lunch instead of chips or pretzels.  Most of the time they take a couple bags because they share them!  I like the one oz. bags because they tide me over at that 3:00 snack time without letting me indulge with too many.  I've had the Olive and the chocolate, but the multigrain are by far my favorite.

4,Had No Problem.  They Like This One a Lot,"I wondered why my 10-month olds liked this one so much when the other reviews weren't so promising.  Then I noted that it has twice the calories as the green bean casserole and sweet ingredients that are proven winners with my kids.<br /><br />Here's the ingredient list: Water, Organic Carrots, Organic Mango Puree, Organic Finely Ground Chicken, Organic Whole Grain Brown Rice Flour, Organic Yellow Split Pea Flakes, Calcium Carbonate.<br /><br />Anything that starts with carrots and mango is going to be fairly sweet, and this one is sweet.  The consistency seemed very normal, perhaps because it has plenty of water - that's the first ingredient.  Unlike most Earth Best flavor brands, this one has calcium.  The stated amount is 35% of their daily needs.  I've been informed that the percentage of daily needs met is based on an adult.<br /><br />I recommend this particular one, Chicken Mango Risotto, because I think babies will tend to like it as mine did.<br /><br />These cases are being delivered to my home constantly, different varieties of Earth's Best subscriptions.  On occasion a case will arrive in a mess with one or more broken jars. Over time I figured out it would cost the vendor too much to package these jars well enough to ensure no breakage. Now when a case arrives with one or more broken jars, I report it and can get credited for the broken ones only. Of course it's messy when a jar is broken, but I don't have a store nearby that sells this product except one that lists it at a higher price.",Positive,wondered month old liked one much review werent promising noted twice calorie green bean casserole sweet ingredient proven winner kidsheres ingredient list water organic carrot organic mango puree organic finely ground chicken organic whole grain brown rice flour organic yellow split pea flake calcium carbonateanything start carrot mango going fairly sweet one sweet consistency seemed normal perhaps plenty water thats first ingredient unlike earth best flavor brand one calcium stated amount daily need ive informed percentage daily need met based adulti recommend particular one chicken mango risotto think baby tend like mine didthese case delivered home constantly different variety earth best subscription occasion case arrive mess one broken jar time figured would cost vendor much package jar well enough ensure breakage case arrives one broken jar report get credited broken one course messy jar broken dont store nearby sell product except one list higher price

I was looking for an alternative to soda at work with lunch, and Mio is okay, though I haven't found it in lemon flavor at the store. Saw this lemon-lime, and I don't regret it. The flavor is great, and the packets couldn't be more convenient. I tuck one into my purse when going out to lunch and put it in water, or just add it to water from the cooler at the office. Definitely makes me drink more water than I would otherwise. I like it at the sweetest ratio on the package, though even that is not overwhelmingly sweet--it's low-level sweet and tasty.

Two weeks of the combo up there on a guided camping trip and I was hooked enough to buy some online here in the States when I returned.  I have not tried it as a hot or cold chocolate drink, but using one mounded tablespoon in a latte cup of coffee is delicious.  Perhaps it is like a mocha (have never tried one), but so easy and SOOOOO GOOD.  I believe a 14.1 ounce container will last two months for 1 person using it as I did and once a day.  In addition to the flavor, I like the fact Milo also contains a combination of B vitamins and magnesium, which according to the label helps release energy from proteins, fats and carbohydrates in food.

5,Magical Beauty Product,"I bought this on a whim at my natural foods store, but I will be purchasing it here in the future because it is much cheaper online.  I have read all over the internet that this is a great beauty product, and really wonderful for your hair.  I started doing weekly vinegar scalp treatments (50/50 ratio with water) a few weeks ago, and I have noticed a dramatic decrease in the amount of hair that I'm shedding.  I apply the treatment directly to my scalp using a hair dye application bottle (with a small pointed tip), and then wrap my hair up in a towel for about an hour.  I then wash it out and style normally. I am not sure how it works, but I am now losing about 1/4 of the hair that I used to during my daily washing/styling routine.  I also noticed that my scalp doesn't itch anymore.  It was never a big problem in the past, but it is something that I have noticed :)<br /><br />I also started having acne a few months ago, and I went to my doctor, and he prescribed an antibiotic cream, because he thought it was an allergic reaction to something.  The antibiotic cream didn't clear up the acne.  On a whim (again), I applied a 50/50 ratio of Bragg's vinegar to my face at night on a cotton ball (I take off my makeup with this mixture instead of washing my face; I hate washing my face at night for some reason), and within a week, my acne completely cleared up.  Again, I don't have any idea how this works, but it has worked wonderfully for me.<br /><br />My skin loves this stuff, and I am so happy that I found it.  I am also so thankful that it is nontoxic and it doesn't have a bunch of harmful chemicals in it.  Next to coconut oil, this vinegar is my holy grail beauty product :)",Positive,bought whim natural food store purchasing future much cheaper online read internet great beauty product really wonderful hair started weekly vinegar scalp treatment ratio water week ago noticed dramatic decrease amount hair im shedding apply treatment directly scalp using hair dye application bottle small pointed tip wrap hair towel hour wash style normally sure work losing hair used daily washingstyling routine also noticed scalp doesnt itch anymore never big problem past something noticed also started acne month ago went doctor prescribed antibiotic cream thought allergic reaction something antibiotic cream didnt clear acne whim applied ratio bragg vinegar face night cotton ball take makeup mixture instead washing face hate washing face night reason within week acne completely cleared dont idea work worked wonderfully memy skin love stuff happy found also thankful nontoxic doesnt bunch harmful chemical next coconut oil vinegar holy grail beauty product

But, it was very expensive and the Teecino was half the price (on sale), so I decided to give it a try. I'm glad I did! I am very much enjoying this beverage (with a little milk or almond milk.) I have explored the company website, too, and learned that even decaf coffee may contribute to heart arrhythmia. The health information provided by the company website was convincing and I feel that switching to this will be a healthy change for me. I also found out that they have about 16 flavors, so I have ordered a sampler and looking forward to trying the others. I usually bake biscotti to give to friends for Christmas and I'm thinking of buying a couple more variety sets and including a couple of samples with each gift.<br /><br />I'm glad to see that this product is available through subscribe and save here at Amazon.

Ripped the packaging and dug right in.  As soon at it hit my mouth I knew.  These are NOT the same as they once were.  They taste fine, but they are not the same.  I think licorice laces you get at CVS or RiteAid for $0.99 are closer to the taste of ""Delfa Rolls"" than these are.  I'm very very disappointed!",Negative,excited year later decide bring delfa roll danish ribbon back seeing reminded childhood bought case took way long receive package came day latest estimation date busted box fast ripped packaging dug right soon hit mouth knew taste fine think licorice lace get cv riteaid closer taste delfa roll im disappointed

5,Wonderful stuff!,"I am very leery of ""energy drinks."" I have never tried Red Bull or Rockstar, and I really don't plan on it either. The thought of pumping myself with artificial energy (sugar and caffeine) and then crashing hard is just not very appealing to me. So, I was likewise hesitant with 5-hour Energy.<br /><br />After hearing all of the radio ads, though, and constantly seeing these little red bottles on the gas station counters, I had to give it a shot. I kind of coughed it down the first time as the flavor wasn't real great to me, but I figured it was only 2 ounces and I could get it down. I'm sure glad I did, because I was amazed at what it did for me. Using vitamins and minerals (and the same caffeine dose as in a cup of coffee), I was given energy that lasted and did not cause me to crash!<br /><br />I try to keep some of this stuff on hand (berry is my favorite by the way) and I usually take this when I am feeling like I really need a nap but the nap isn't an option. While it doesn't instantaneously feel like leaping off roofs, if I can motivate myself to start some project, within a half an hour I notice I am not tired anymore! This energetic (and non-sleepy) feeling last for quite a while too, so I don't take this beyond perhaps 4 or 5pm if I want to get to sleep that night.<br /><br />I cannot tell you how many people I have gotten started on this. Usually it starts with something like this: Them--""Does that stuff really work?"" Me--""Yes! It's awesome, and it isn't like most energy drinks. This is really vitamins. Here, try this!"" Them (two weeks later)--""Wow! That stuff really does work. I have been buying it now!""<br /><br />This is highly recommended for safe and healthy pick-me-ups! (Can I give it 10 stars?)",Positive,leery energy drink never tried red bull rockstar really dont plan either thought pumping artificial energy sugar caffeine crashing hard appealing likewise hesitant hour energyafter hearing radio ad though constantly seeing little red bottle gas station counter give shot kind coughed first time flavor wasnt real great figured ounce could get im sure glad amazed using vitamin mineral caffeine dose cup coffee given energy lasted cause crashi try keep stuff hand berry favorite way usually take feeling like really need nap nap isnt option doesnt instantaneously feel like leaping roof motivate start project within half hour notice tired anymore energetic nonsleepy feeling last quite dont take beyond perhaps pm want get sleep nighti tell many people gotten started usually start something like themdoes stuff really work meyes awesome isnt like energy drink really vitamin try two week laterwow stuff really work buying nowthis highly recommended safe healthy pickmeups give star

4,A mild smooth coffee,"There are several things a coffee lover looks for in their brew.. the aroma, the color and the taste are what I look for. When I opened the individual pack, I was hit with a wonderful coffee scent.  The pod looks typical, and are made for a pod machine.  When I made my first cup, since the aroma was strong, I filled the machine with a good sized mug's worth of water, and made a cup.  When it was done, the color was fairly light, so I only added a small amount of milk.  Still, the flavor was a bit too bland for me, and I like a mild coffee.  For the second cup, I used a smaller mug, and in return got a darker, more flavorful cup, so that is my recommendation with this brand.  Some other things I love about this brand:  it's organic, sustainably grown and Fair Trade certified. That's a lot of benefits for only about 75 cents a cup.  The even have their own foundation to support youth soccer programs.  This is a good deal.  The only thing that I would change is the individual wrap, which seems like an excess of packaging for a company dedicated to the environment.",Positive,several thing coffee lover look brew aroma color taste look opened individual pack hit wonderful coffee scent pod look typical made pod machine made first cup since aroma strong filled machine good sized mug worth water made cup done color fairly light added small amount milk still flavor bit bland like mild coffee second cup used smaller mug return got darker flavorful cup recommendation brand thing love brand organic sustainably grown fair trade certified thats lot benefit cent cup even foundation support youth soccer program good deal thing would change individual wrap seems like excess packaging company dedicated environment

1,Inferior Coffee,"Aloha Island Coffee Company Bonzai Pipeline Dark Roast is a very mediocre, insipid coffee, rather acidic for a dark roast. The beans are of unknown origin, but if there are any Kona beans in this anonymous mix, they must be the ones other roasters threw out as it doesn't even vaguely taste like Kona. Actually, Aloha Island Coffee Co. isn't even in Hawaii, it's located in Santa Ana, CA, an area not exactly known for great coffee. The coffee is extremely overpriced for the poor quality you get, which is why I gave it one star, and you would be better off buying some of the better brands commonly sold in supermarkets at about one-third the price. I ordered the 2-8 oz bags, but I couldn't even make it through the first one and have thrown the second in the garbage.

It's also the first tea that my husband actually likes too!  I do believe we've found a winner in our house.<br /><br />Tea lightweights that we are, we get about four cups of tea out of one pouch. I suggest brewing all at once, rather than a cup at a time. If you do it a cup at a time, the first cup will be VERY fruity, and the last one won't have much fruit at all.

The other ingrediant was a chopped canned or bottled red roasted pepper (approx. 12 oz).  I use a 12 oz jar of Zergut Mild Ajvar (has peppers and eggplant) and it was out of this world! Not too spicy and my totally American Family loves it.  I also add some macaroni for a hearty meal.  Ralphs in Orange County, CA was carrying this product, but I can't find it any longer.

3,Nice iced; not hot.,"Not caring for regular tea or the caffeine, I drink herbal tea exclusively and am always on the lookout for fun new flavors.  This Blackberry Vanilla sounded delicious,, not a flavor combination I had seen before.  I should also mention that my true test for how well I end up really liking a tea's flavor is whether or not I need sweetener.  If I need it then the flavor is most likely too bitter for me.<br /><br />Out of the box, the tea bags have a bit of a dried flowers smell, not very fruity.  However, when it is brewing the fragrance is delicious!  The berries wake up, and the vanilla too.<br /><br />I tried this tea both hot and iced.  As a hot tea, the flavor was alright, but it was like there were too many herbs and not enough berries.  I did end up needing a bit of sweetener, as I felt the flavor was too earthy.  The vanilla was too subtle to detect.<br /><br />It was when I tried this tea iced that I found I really enjoyed it.  The cold seems to suit the berry flavors nicely, I can taste the vanilla, and I didn't need any sweetener at all.<br /><br />I have never cared for Lipton's pyramid tea bag packaging.  There is nothing protecting the tea bags inside of the box, such as a paper liner, and since the pyramid shaped tea bags are too awkward to be individually wrapped, it's just open tea bags sitting together in a paperboard box.  Also, the bags and string are some sort of plastic-like material, so I cannot put them in my compost bin.<br /><br />As an iced tea, I liked the Blackberry Vanilla.  But the flavor as hot tea and the less-than-desirable packaging keep me from getting excited about it.",Neutral,caring regular tea caffeine drink herbal tea exclusively always lookout fun new flavor blackberry vanilla sounded delicious flavor combination seen also mention true test well end really liking tea flavor whether need sweetener need flavor likely bitter meout box tea bag bit dried flower smell fruity however brewing fragrance delicious berry wake vanilla tooi tried tea hot iced hot tea flavor alright like many herb enough berry end needing bit sweetener felt flavor earthy vanilla subtle detectit tried tea iced found really enjoyed cold seems suit berry flavor nicely taste vanilla didnt need sweetener alli never cared liptons pyramid tea bag packaging nothing protecting tea bag inside box paper liner since pyramid shaped tea bag awkward individually wrapped open tea bag sitting together paperboard box also bag string sort plasticlike material put compost binas iced tea liked blackberry vanilla flavor hot tea lessthandesirable packaging keep getting excited

She is quite young (only  1.5 years) so her teeth are still lovely and very clean.  I hope these ""digestive"" aids will help her teeth, I'd like to keep them that way.

When I first opened the shipping box in my kitchen, a small fleet of moths seemingly came out of nowhere and starting swarming the box. So, I'd say that this is pretty potent love stuff for them! The downside of course is having the traps laying around with dead moths (or struggling moribund moths) stuck to them.

I would say the effects lasted past the 5-hour mark as I was still feeling awake and alert around midnight (7 hours after drinking a full bottle). Of course results will vary but mine excellent on the first try. I'll update next week or anytime thereafter if I have any negative or interesting effects.<br /><br />UPDATE 2-10-2011:<br />I held out and didn't try another bottle until my Wednesday class came around again and I had the same effects as last week.

5,"Complex, European, flavorful coffee","I am a coffee lover and quite picky about my coffees. Every coffee brand claims hand-picked gourmet coffee, so it is hard to find a good bean. As with many things, coffee is a matter of personal taste. I don't like the bitter flavor of Starbucks, for example, which is the result of their trademark roast. I like flavorful coffe that is not bitter. I loved this coffee from Melitta.<br /><br />It is complex and rich, very european in flavor and not bitter at all.

5,DID I FORGET TO MENTION? -- IT TASTES GOOD TOO!!!,"""Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ"" is one of the healthiest and tastiest foods you have available at your local grocery. When you read the label, you see a lot of nutrition and few calories for just 2 tablespoons. But much of what wheat germ has is not on the label. For instance, it promotes gentle regularity and is an excellent source of chromium, selenium, and other trace minerals. It is also a balanced package of protein, carbohydrates and fat, without saturated fat. It promotes heart health and provides an energetic feeling. Mixed with vitamin C, some people use it as a very effective antihistamine without side effects.<br /><br />Since 1982, I have incorporated ""Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ"" into my daily diet. The easiest ways to achieve this are as follows:<br /><br />1] Adding to cold cereal, oatmeal, yogurt, soups, homemade bread, puddings, macaroni and cheese, applesauce and literally anything you want that has sufficient moisture.<br /><br />2] Substituting wheat germ for bread crumbs in meatloaf, veal/ chicken cutlets, or any fried batter.<br /><br />Kretschmer's Wheat Germ comes toasted in a vacuum-sealed bottle which makes it a very stable and fresh product. It even has an expiration date printed across the top of the bottle in plain sight. Raw wheat germ from the health food store tastes awful, turns rancid sometimes before you buy it, and is usually poorly packaged.<br /><br />This ""Kretschmer Original Toasted Wheat Germ"" gets a 5 for nutrition, ease of use, packaging, and value which makes Kretschmer's Wheat Germ hard to beat. Oh, I forget to mention --IT TASTES GOOD TOO!<br /><br />DOWNSIDE: This 12 ounce package costs only $1.00 less than the 20-ounce package and should be passed by when the 20-ounce size is available. Sometimes the 20-ounce size is out of stock or absent from store shelves so check first.",Positive,kretschmer original toasted wheat germ one healthiest tastiest food available local grocery read label see lot nutrition calorie tablespoon much wheat germ label instance promotes gentle regularity excellent source chromium selenium trace mineral also balanced package protein carbohydrate fat without saturated fat promotes heart health provides energetic feeling mixed vitamin c people use effective antihistamine without side effectssince incorporated kretschmer original toasted wheat germ daily diet easiest way achieve follows adding cold cereal oatmeal yogurt soup homemade bread pudding macaroni cheese applesauce literally anything want sufficient moisture substituting wheat germ bread crumb meatloaf veal chicken cutlet fried batterkretschmers wheat germ come toasted vacuumsealed bottle make stable fresh product even expiration date printed across top bottle plain sight raw wheat germ health food store taste awful turn rancid sometimes buy usually poorly packagedthis kretschmer original toasted wheat germ get nutrition ease use packaging value make kretschmers wheat germ hard beat oh forget mention taste good toodownside ounce package cost less ounce package passed ounce size available sometimes ounce size stock absent store shelf check first

Companies normally use this plastic for various beverage containers such as water, soft drinks, and sport drinks. You can also find this plastic for ketchup, peanut butter, salad dressings, jellies, and various other condiments. This plastic is known as one of the ""good"" plastics since it is not known to leach, or gradually penetrate, chemicals into the products it houses.""

Thinking it was ""cheap"" (after all, I bought it at a street fair), I ordered Two Leaves and a Bud brand from Amazon and it was awful!

3,The jury is still out....,"Was recommended this product by my acupuncturist to help with sleep and to keep the body 'regular.' Been taking Natural Calm Plus Calcium for 3 nights now. I am a small person, so only started with a half a teaspoon. I put it in Decaf Green Tea and take it before bed. It tastes fine, a little sweet. Now it's Day 3, and I don't know if this is one of those products that require 8 hours of sleep, but I feel foggy and exhausted, and have that 'sleeping pill' feeling, like I took a sleep aid but didn't sleep enough. (I sleep about 7 hours a night.) It's really not pleasant.<br />Am willing to try it some more, and will also be trying just the 'plain' Calm without the Calcium, Potassium, and Boron. Maybe those are messing with my head, not sure. Yesterday afternoon I was feeling funny, nauseous and also foggy in the head.

It was like a miracle.  From the first time I ground up my beans and made my first pot of Lavazza coffee, life has been so much better for me in the morning.

4,Yummy Iced Coffee,"I'll start by saying that I'm usually not a fan of Starbucks coffee in general, but I decided to try this since I love iced coffee and don't always feel like making a coffee run every time I want some.  With that being said, this coffee is delicious, not to mention incredibly convenient.  I start my day by taking a shaker cup filled with skim milk, a packet of coffee, and an equal or two, shake it up and throw it in the fridge.  Then whenever I want some iced coffee it's prepared and ready to go.  The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I would prefer if it came unsweetened.  Obviously, since I add equal I don't find it to be too sweet, but I don't really use sugar and would prefer if I could just use my choice of sweetener instead.",Positive,ill start saying im usually fan starbucks coffee general decided try since love iced coffee dont always feel like making coffee run every time want said coffee delicious mention incredibly convenient start day taking shaker cup filled skim milk packet coffee equal two shake throw fridge whenever want iced coffee prepared ready go reason im giving star instead would prefer came unsweetened obviously since add equal dont find sweet dont really use sugar would prefer could use choice sweetener instead

4,It's healthy,"This is a wholesome beverage for drinking and on cereal.  I have been using Silk soy milk for coffee and tea and when I saw this rice milk which IMO is a better food to put in my body than soy milk, and for less that what I pay for Silk, I thought I'd give it a try.  For coffee and tea is is not even half as creamy as Silk so it falls short there.  I had figured it would be a thinner product but since Amazon's nutritional data stated 80 calories per cup, as opposed to 100 per cup of Silk, I figured I could use a bit more rice milk to make up for it's more watery consistency.  Well turns out Amazon's data is wrong, the rice milk has 100 calories per cup also.  There are other discrepancies between Amazon's data and what is printed on the box.  So it's a good product and I like the taste although I prefer the less sweet original version of Silk.  I will happily use my 12 cartons of this rice milk but will go back to Silk when it's all gone.",Positive,wholesome beverage drinking cereal using silk soy milk coffee tea saw rice milk imo better food put body soy milk less pay silk thought id give try coffee tea even half creamy silk fall short figured would thinner product since amazon nutritional data stated calorie per cup opposed per cup silk figured could use bit rice milk make watery consistency well turn amazon data wrong rice milk calorie per cup also discrepancy amazon data printed box good product like taste although prefer less sweet original version silk happily use carton rice milk go back silk gone

5,Great idea and great coffee,"I tried the San Francisco Bay Coffee Fog Chaser since they have reduced the cost & plastic waste by reducing the packaging. I love a good strong cup of coffee and I love my Keurig brewer.  But I am a cheapskate at heart and hated paying the price for the regular K-cups. This is a great compromise.<br />Since it does not have the plastic cup base and is just a round filter hanging from the top ring, you have to keep them sealed in a zip-lock or similar air tight container or they will not stay fresh.  That is a small inconvenience I can live with.  They also reduce our use of plastic and the trash we generate and I suspect that there may be health benefits from not brewing the coffee in the little plastic cup.",Positive,tried san francisco bay coffee fog chaser since reduced cost plastic waste reducing packaging love good strong cup coffee love keurig brewer cheapskate heart hated paying price regular kcups great compromisesince plastic cup base round filter hanging top ring keep sealed ziplock similar air tight container stay fresh small inconvenience live also reduce use plastic trash generate suspect may health benefit brewing coffee little plastic cup

1,Bone chucks are a blockage hazard.,"This was an X-mas gift for my dog and he loved it.  Then a couple days later he stopped eating, threw up bile everywhere, and became very lethargic.

The medical bills cost two and a half times the dog but he recovered after quite a bit of worrying on my part.<br /><br />This product is purchased for the express purpose of a dog chewing on it, but unlike rawhide it is not digestible and can cause serious problems including the need for surgery.

It is the very best food that I have ever found. Not only does it take care of the gas problem but she gobbles it up. So good to find a dog food that she not only enjoys but is good for her too.

We bought 2 boxes and managed to make them last 4 days (not easy considering how light they are) and tried them with coffee, hot tea and milk. All good but my preference is the hot tea. A great afternoon treat.<br />The only drawback is that you pay shipping per box and the shipping is higher than the cookies, but still worth it.",Positive,first heard jaffa cake reading gold box forum pleasantly surprised opened one box wonderful angelfood type cooky thin layer tasty marmalade covered delicious dark chocolate coating taste distinctive flavor bought box managed make last day easy considering light tried coffee hot tea milk good preference hot tea great afternoon treatthe drawback pay shipping per box shipping higher cooky still worth

3,"Thin Box, Thin Flavor","While no worse than your average bowl of Raisin Bran, I was disappointed that I didn't find this to be noticeably better. The flavor of cinnamon could certainly be stronger (for my tastes, anyway), and the little slivers of almonds didn't really add to the ""crunch"" in any sort of meaningful way. And unlike the experience of some other reviewers, I found that this Raisin Bran got soggy remarkably fast after the milk was added, turning to slurry by the last few bites. I've definitely had other Raisin and Bran products that remained crisp longer.<br /><br />I was also a bit taken aback by the box, which holds only 14.5 ounces of cereal. It's the same height and width as the regular cereal box you'd see on the store shelf, but to hide the fact that you're not getting much cereal, the box is so skinny that I actually had trouble getting it to stand on end a time or two. And maybe this is common to a lot of cereals these days - it was just new to me.<br /><br />Overall, I've got nothing bad to say about this product...but to give it a rating of more than 3 stars, I'd have to feel like it was ""better than average"" somehow.

4,Love it!,"We installed our pet door about 2 weeks ago and so far it works great! Our two dogs are taking awhile to get used to it. At first they were scared of it, now they both use it but one of the dogs doesn't realize yet that I don't have to be right there for him to go out. I'm sure he will figure it out as time goes on.<br /><br />My only advice would be to not necessarily follow the instructions on what height to put the door at (it says to put the bottom of the door an inch lower than your dog's chest height). We followed the directions on the height to install it at, and our 40 and 50 lb dogs practically have to leap out the door rather than calmly walking out. Other than that, I love it!<br /><br />We did go on the High Tech website and ask a question before we bought it and never got a response, so it seems like most people's reviews about bad customer service are true...",Positive,installed pet door week ago far work great two dog taking awhile get used first scared use one dog doesnt realize yet dont right go im sure figure time go onmy advice would necessarily follow instruction height put door say put bottom door inch lower dog chest height followed direction height install lb dog practically leap door rather calmly walking love itwe go high tech website ask question bought never got response seems like people review bad customer service true

2,Strongly sweet and too one dimensional,"My first impression is that this product is just another way to sell artificial sweetener. I tried 2 flavors and the overwhelming characteristic is sweetness. Some may like this, but I do not. The main drawback, though, is the flavoring is not very complex. What I mean is that there is a narrow range of flavor receptors working on your tongue when you drink it. Cast in this mixture of sweetness is a single flavor, it seems. It is not complex; you clearly taste just 2 things: sweetness and a specific flavor.<br /><br />If you enjoy drinking something that is refreshing and/or interesting, this isn't it. For example, if you add a freshly squeezed lemon and some sugar to your water, your whole mouth seems to pick up a range of flavors and sensations that leaves a slight, but satisfying aftertaste. The MiO, on the other hand, hits your tongue with a strong blast of sweetness and flavor, disappears, then leaves an aftertaste lingering on the back of your tongue of that vague, yet strangely familiar taste all artificial sweeteners seem to have.<br /><br />There are better ways to flavor water, I'm afraid, than this.",Negative,first impression product another way sell artificial sweetener tried flavor overwhelming characteristic sweetness may like main drawback though flavoring complex mean narrow range flavor receptor working tongue drink cast mixture sweetness single flavor seems complex clearly taste thing sweetness specific flavorif enjoy drinking something refreshing andor interesting isnt example add freshly squeezed lemon sugar water whole mouth seems pick range flavor sensation leaf slight satisfying aftertaste mio hand hit tongue strong blast sweetness flavor disappears leaf aftertaste lingering back tongue vague yet strangely familiar taste artificial sweetener seem havethere better way flavor water im afraid

To my taste buds, this does not taste rich and chocolate-y despite its name of ""Double Chocolate Meltdown"".<br /><br />But - I add it every day to my morning coffee and for that purpose, it is the best hot chocolate powder around. I've tried many different brands and chocolate flavors but nothing comes close to putting this one in my coffee.

I make about 4 double shots, but brew it more like an americano - into a small pyrex cup.  Then I allow it to cool, pour it into a container with a little ice, and the next morning, voila - Iced Americano as soon as I wake up without having to mess with the espresso machine.

5,For RICE CAKE HATERS...,"Thought I'd never eat anything with ""rice cake"" on the label...hated the whole concept since the 80's.<br /><br />However, they were sampling these at my Costco in Seattle and I hadn't eaten all day.  O.M.G. Delicious!  Lots of flavor, lots of crunch, mostly light and crispy but with some harder, crackly bits here and there which mixes up that texture a bit.  They have a really nice, lingering black pepper burn (don't be scared, it's about the equivelant of 1/2 star if you're thinking Asian food spice level)!<br />They apparently have a little garlic and onion flavoring, as well as yeast (nice umami quality) and there's some corn too, which probably explains the harder crunchy element.<br />The first ingredient is germless brown rice.<br /><br />Costco has them in 17oz bags for around $4 or so...can't remember exact price.<br /><br />Love them!",Positive,thought id never eat anything rice cake labelhated whole concept since showever sampling costco seattle hadnt eaten day omg delicious lot flavor lot crunch mostly light crispy harder crackly bit mix texture bit really nice lingering black pepper burn dont scared equivelant star youre thinking asian food spice levelthey apparently little garlic onion flavoring well yeast nice umami quality there corn probably explains harder crunchy elementthe first ingredient germless brown ricecostco oz bag around socant remember exact pricelove

2,Crunched Crunch,"Got these with a one-day shipping delay, but still very quickly with Amazon Prime.  The taste is quite good, perhaps a little on the sweet side - especially when you hit a pocket of white chocolate.  The big problem is the condition of the product when it arrives.  I opened my first 2-pack and the granola bars were crushed into nuggets and powder.  Strangely, the box wasn't in bad shape, just the bars.  A few days later, I opened the other box of granola bars, which was in better shape than the first one, and the first pack I tried again contained smashed fragments of granola bars.  These are no fun to eat, as you can't really open the pack and pour it into your mouth (I tried), and if you pick out the big chunks you get fragments and powder sticking to your fingers, and on your clothes (and in your beard).  I'll eat the rest, maybe out of a bowl with a spoon or something (with some fava beans and a nice chianti...), but I won't be ordering any more crunched Clif Crunch bars.",Negative,got oneday shipping delay still quickly amazon prime taste quite good perhaps little sweet side especially hit pocket white chocolate big problem condition product arrives opened first pack granola bar crushed nugget powder strangely box wasnt bad shape bar day later opened box granola bar better shape first one first pack tried contained smashed fragment granola bar fun eat cant really open pack pour mouth tried pick big chunk get fragment powder sticking finger clothes beard ill eat rest maybe bowl spoon something fava bean nice chianti wont ordering crunched clif crunch bar
5,Great Green Tea and Great Company!,"This is a great decaf green tea. I decided to start drinking green tea due to its purported benefits of prevention of breast cancer, which runs rampant in my family.  I have to drink a decaf product, which is unfortunate as some of the beneficial properties of green tea are removed with the caffeine.  After some research, I found out that there are several ""natural"" methods of decaffeination and that one involves actually using ""natural"" but not necessarily safe chemicals.  Probably the safest method is a process which involves using carbon dioxide.  I emailed Stash about this product and within an hour received a very informative, personalized email describing the process they use, which is the CO2 process and the best as not only does it not use chemicals, but the antioxidant properties of green tea are diminished less with this process than others.  Since I am drinking green tea solely for the health benefits and not the taste, that is important to me.  I think it tastes great for a decaff tea.  It is not strong and has a mild slightly bitter taste.  I add a little peppermint tea and honey to it and it is super tasty. I am impressed with this tea and company and will continue to order from them.",Positive,great decaf green tea decided start drinking green tea due purported benefit prevention breast cancer run rampant family drink decaf product unfortunate beneficial property green tea removed caffeine research found several natural method decaffeination one involves actually using natural necessarily safe chemical probably safest method process involves using carbon dioxide emailed stash product within hour received informative personalized email describing process use co process best use chemical antioxidant property green tea diminished less process others since drinking green tea solely health benefit taste important think taste great decaff tea strong mild slightly bitter taste add little peppermint tea honey super tasty impressed tea company continue order

1,eww,"I'm not a huge ginger fan, but I have had a lot of ginger tea and the like lately because of a pregnancy (its supposed to ease an upset stomach). This stuff I would not reach for again. In fact, I might not even finish the cup in front of me. It's really....bitter? No, not even that. There's that weird sort of tang ginger has, and this has it big-time, even though I actually watered it down more than I should have (really, it's about 1 packet to 1 measured cup of water). I really only taste the lemon as an aftertaste.<br /><br />Also, the actual stuff is a bit weird. If you're used to the now common little packets of powder you add to a bottle of water, this is WAY more powder to mix in. The packet is about the size of a large teabag, but full. It's also a different consistency...almost looks like small betta fish food.

5,Agrees with sensitive tummies.,"My 1-year old black lab mix has had stomach issues since small puppyhood, and it took me months to find the right food (and then the right portions) to stabilize his tummy.

I finally settled on Natural Balance Venison & Sweet Potato, and haven't looked back.<br /><br />My dog will eat literally anything, and ate every kind of dog food I put in front of him with equal enthusiasm. But I do appreciate that with Natural Balance, I found a food that agrees with his stomach, gives him the high quality nutrition he needs to run endlessly around the yard chasing balls and squirrels and his dog friends, and is actually fairly reasonably priced.<br /><br />Love that Amazon delivers it for free right to my door, too.

I don't actually mind the label on front that says ""nonfat dry milk added, chunked and formed"" but I'm weirded out by having sucralose added to my jerky. I can also say that although the flavor (pepper) is nice, I am definitely not a fan of pink soft flat moist ""jerkee.""  Its texture is kinda like eating raw hamburger meat yet it's extruded appearance makes it even less appetizing. Some people may love it but just be aware that this is not jerky.

1,Taste is fine but texture induces nausea,"I read the very mixed reviews, and thought this would be worth a try.  The general advice seemed to say 'follow the directions closely' and try to use a thicker, non-tomato based, sauce.  So, here is my experience:<br /><br />1.  Opened the package.  It smells of the sea - fishy.  The noodles themselves have no color, opaque.<br /><br />2.  Rinsed the noodles off in a colander.  The fishy smell mostly went away.<br /><br />3.  Placed the noodles in boiling water for 1-2 minutes.<br /><br />4.  Poured the noodles back into the colander.  The noodles are now a white color and hardly opaque, so to 'blanche' has a dual meaning here.<br /><br />5.  Dried noodles, per instructions.<br /><br />6.  Doused noodles in an Alfredo sauce.<br /><br />Took a bite.  The taste is fine.  The noodles are slimy and nearly impossible to chew.  Took a second bite.  Almost threw up.  Ate some veggies and tried again, with the exact same results.<br /><br />My wife had the exact same opinion.  We didn't want to traumatize the kid's with this, because it's hard enough getting them to eat the good stuff.<br /><br />What it comes down to is that the texture is just unbearable, it literally induced nausea in both of us.  The fishy smell I can deal with, it was quite faint, but maybe that plays a part too.<br /><br />We'll give it another shot, once we build up some courage or completely forget last night.  If that doesn't change things, then what packs are left will get handed out to friends, since it seems that many have a different opinion.",Negative,read mixed review thought would worth try general advice seemed say follow direction closely try use thicker nontomato based sauce experience opened package smell sea fishy noodle color opaque rinsed noodle colander fishy smell mostly went away placed noodle boiling water minute poured noodle back colander noodle white color hardly opaque blanche dual meaning dried noodle per instruction doused noodle alfredo saucetook bite taste fine noodle slimy nearly impossible chew took second bite almost threw ate veggie tried exact resultsmy wife exact opinion didnt want traumatize kid hard enough getting eat good stuffwhat come texture unbearable literally induced nausea u fishy smell deal quite faint maybe play part toowell give another shot build courage completely forget last night doesnt change thing pack left get handed friend since seems many different opinion

Lately I have been drinking whatever I bring from home (usually something similar to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026I0O14"">Propel Fitness Water</a>) or just water from the dispenser.  The thing I've noticed with the sports drinks are that they actually leave me thirstier and water usually leaves me full once I'm able to drink enough to quench my thirst.<br /><br />I did read some of the reviews before deciding to try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005HG9ET0"">Essentia 9.5 pH</a> and based on them being mostly positive I wanted to give it a try. The bottle I received lasted me the entire day at work and I didn't have to go searching for more which was nice. The taste was much better than tap and even better than the bottled dispenser water we have.  As for the claims of ""helps maintain normal blood pressure, restful sleep, heart health, muscle strength and more"" I can't really prove or disprove them after just one bottle. The only thing I can say is that I did feel like it quenched my thirst better than anything I've been drinking. Is it all in my imagination?

5,A Treat in a Brown Box...,"First and foremost, having enjoyed the 'Blonde' variety of Starbucks since it's conception, it's pointless for me to tell you that I buy this product religiously and think it to be the best coffee on the market today.  What I can tell you is about the packaging for the 54-count package and my experience with K-Cups, in general.<br /><br />If you opt to go with the higher count package, please note that it does *not* come in retail box packaging.  Sure, the K-Cups are the same but, you get a brown box versus several 'retail' packages.  This, to me, isn't a big deal in the least.  It's not a large box and I'd rather recycle one box than several smaller ones.  My point - if this is an issue to you, buy in a different quantity.  Secondly, the K-Cup patent is a great one but, unfortunately for Keurig, it's days are numbered.  While I've tried to grind my own beans and use a ECOBREW reusable K-Cup filter to get the same results as the Veranda Blend K-Cup, I've been unsuccessful in getting it 'how I want it'.  As such, I've continued to pay a higher price per cup of coffee but, in the end, I still think it to be worth it -- it's a very unique blend.  What I can assure you is that the prices per cup will likely fall off upon the expiration of the K-Cup patent.  For that, I'll keep my wallet handy for these until they hopefully fall off in price due to competition in the near future.<br /><br />A+ service by Amazon, as usual, with PRIME!",Positive,first foremost enjoyed blonde variety starbucks since conception pointless tell buy product religiously think best coffee market today tell packaging count package experience kcups generalif opt go higher count package please note come retail box packaging sure kcups get brown box versus several retail package isnt big deal least large box id rather recycle one box several smaller one point issue buy different quantity secondly kcup patent great one unfortunately keurig day numbered ive tried grind bean use ecobrew reusable kcup filter get result veranda blend kcup ive unsuccessful getting want ive continued pay higher price per cup coffee end still think worth unique blend assure price per cup likely fall upon expiration kcup patent ill keep wallet handy hopefully fall price due competition near futurea service amazon usual prime

Even the store brands taste better than the SodaStream diet drinks.  They remind me of the pre-Nutrasweet sodas that used saccharine as the sweetener.

4,Great Alternative to Using A Real Lemon,"I first had True Lemon in a local eatery and found that I liked it.  As I always use real lemons in my water and they seem to go bad before I use them all, I thought this would be a great substitute for the real thing.

This is the only coffee we have found in the US that is ground fine enough (finer than ""supermarket"" espresson grind) to let the full flavor and aroma out.  If you can find a grinder with a sufficiently fine grinding setting you might notice, as we have, that lesser brands of coffee tend to taste much better.<br /><br />Starbuck's coffees, for me, can have a good taste of coffee but the acidic after-taste turns me off.",Positive,wife european u foertunate enough lot business personal international travelling taste open almost anything new except come coffee tea coffee choice douwe egbert intense coffee found u ground fine enough finer supermarket espresson grind let full flavor aroma find grinder sufficiently fine grinding setting might notice lesser brand coffee tend taste much betterstarbucks coffee good taste coffee acidic aftertaste turn

3,Not 100% raisins -- Contains Additive  ---  UPDATED 10-25-12,"I purchased the Made in Nature ""Club Pack"" size because the price was good and the description seemed identical to the Made in Nature product sold as a 12-pack of 6 oz. bags.  The latter product had the following listed for the Nutrition Facts link:  ""Unsulfured, Sun-dried, Certified Organic Seedless Raisins.""  In other words, no additives are listed.  I thought that the Club Pack size would be the same, even though the Amazon description did not include a Nutrition Facts link.  Well, I just got my order today and the packages listed ""organic sunflower oil"" as an additive.  Also, it is disconcerting that the package does not specifically state that the raisins are unsulfured.  I will not be purchasing these raisins again.<br /><br />Update:  I increased my rating after checking further and finding out that the raisins are unsulfured.  Also, the added sunflower oil is apparently less than 1%.  Nevertheless, this information should be listed on the web page.  Sunflower oil apparently reduces clumping of the raisins.  Personally, I would rather have clumping and no sunflower oil since I do not want extra sources of fat in my diet (especially ones that are high in Omega 6 fats).  The raisins themselves are nothing special....they are average in both taste and appearance.<br /><br />UPDATE #2:  After reading recent reviews on this product, I decided to check the Made In Nature website to see if sunflower oil was still being added.  The package label on the website still shows the additive.  However, I sent an e-mail about this to Made In Nature and got the following reply:<br /><br />""Thank you for contacting Made In Nature.<br />We are pleased to hear that you are interested in purchasing our products through Amazon and understand the importance of consumers such as yourself, to be absolutely certain of the ingredients used in products. Currently, we do not add any organic sunflower oil to the raisins, and haven't done so for the past few months. We are also in the process of removing it from the cranberries as well. Our ultimate goal is to have all of our products include only the dried fruit itself.<br />I hope this helps and answers any question you may have regarding the ingredients used in our products. If you have any further questions, comments, or concerns, never hesitate to reach out. Thank you for your support in Made In Nature!<br />Brian McQuillan<br />Made In Nature""<br /><br />As a consequence of this new information, I plan to order the raisins again.

2,WEAKSAUCE,"The quality of the tea itself is not the problem here(though it is not that great), its the quantity in each bag that I have an issue with.  Compared to other brands of organic green tea, these bags seem to contain about half as much green tea leaves, causing me to use two bags for each cup of tea I brew, otherwise I just end up with a dissatisfying cup of weak tea.  Go to Trader Joe's and get a box of their organic green tea,their tea bags are filled generously, and your tea will be a nice bright green!I'm sure there are other great brands of organic green tea, I just have had great experiences with the Trader Joe's brand.

1,unbelievably ridiculous addition to this great cereal: ASPARTAME,"This used to be a favorite a few years ago. Raw taste, nice texture, stays crunchy in hot milk. I loved it! Then I changed to a different brand for a few years just for variation and yesterday went back. Didn't even look at the label.

2,Stevia DOES have some bad side effects!,"I've always heard that Stevia has been used for hundreds of years with no ill side effects, so I was very interested to try it... especially when I started making my own yogurt, and would do anything to get my toddler to eat it! I did some research and found that the SweetLeaf brand was supposed to be the best, as far as extraction methods and experience. I got a bottle of the Vanilla Creme, and also the plain, and added it to our yogurt. It was fantastic! We all loved it, and the toddler begged for more. I was so relieved to have found a great way to reduce the sugar in our diets and still have such a great sweet taste. It was perfect, I was happy. But then, strange symptoms started to surface. At first I got headaches, which became increasingly severe, and then backaches that felt like spinal 'brain freeze' (when you eat something too cold too fast.) It didn't occur to me at first that it could be at all related to the new Stevia. Then my toddler started telling me he was itchy all over. Then I got my menstrual cycle 2 weeks early. Finally it dawned on me that it could be related to the Stevia since this was the only thing at all that had changed in our diets. I googled 'adverse reactions to Stevia' and found several webpages where people described symptoms identical to mine. I was truly shocked. I stopped the Stevia... all the symptoms went away almost immediately. I realize now that there is a difference between the flavored liquid Stevia, which contains a 'proprietary blend' and 'natural flavors' (which could mean anything) and just the straight powder with nothing added (I haven't tried that, but won't now.) It also occurs to me that maybe the only Stevia that can truly be considered historically safe is the actual leaf itself, straight off the plant out of the garden. I still believe Stevia's safety record in the countries where it originated, but I think something has probably been lost in translation with the processing of it here in the US. Just my opinion. It should also be noted that anyone with allergies to ragweed should not take Stevia because it can cause asthma attacks. Hope this helps someone.",Negative,ive always heard stevia used hundred year ill side effect interested try especially started making yogurt would anything get toddler eat research found sweetleaf brand supposed best far extraction method experience got bottle vanilla creme also plain added yogurt fantastic loved toddler begged relieved found great way reduce sugar diet still great sweet taste perfect happy strange symptom started surface first got headache became increasingly severe backache felt like spinal brain freeze eat something cold fast didnt occur first could related new stevia toddler started telling itchy got menstrual cycle week early finally dawned could related stevia since thing changed diet googled adverse reaction stevia found several webpage people described symptom identical mine truly shocked stopped stevia symptom went away almost immediately realize difference flavored liquid stevia contains proprietary blend natural flavor could mean anything straight powder nothing added havent tried wont also occurs maybe stevia truly considered historically safe actual leaf straight plant garden still believe stevia safety record country originated think something probably lost translation processing u opinion also noted anyone allergy ragweed take stevia cause asthma attack hope help someone

5,"Interesting taste, I like it","I wanted to taste it just because I like to taste new stuff, and because it is claimed to be ""superfood"". I liked the taste and now I drink this one or ONE Acai nearly every day, just because I like the taste and because it's conveniently delivered to me by Amazon's subscription.<br /><br />I buy tons of stuff on Amazon and rarely write reviews, but I remember when I first open this web-page I hesitated to buy, because there were a lot of negative reviews. I finally bought it out of curiosity, and was prepared for something awful. It turned out to be one of my favorite drinks. So I thought it would be fair for the product if I write a review.<br /><br />I gave it to other people to taste, and most people liked it. Like with any food, there are personal preferences. Some people drink coffee, some don't. So my advice is - ignore any review (positive and negative). If you want to taste it, taste it.<br /><br />P.S. I'm not telling that Acai juice is any better than let's say blueberry juice. It's just that I like variety, and that Amazon delivers this one to me.

5,Yum!,"As a big fan of sweet potato fries, I was instantly drawn to these chips when I saw them at the grocery store.  I actually bought a few different varieties of Food Should Taste Good chips because I haven't seen them before and they seemed different than other chips.  I'm trying to eat healthier, but not give up all the things I enjoy eating and chips are one of those things.  This particular chip is a great alternative to the normally greesy fried potato chips and they taste just like sweet potatoes.  Apparently they are a combination of sweet potato and corn, but its still good.  Highly recommended as a snacking alternative to regular chips.",Positive,big fan sweet potato fry instantly drawn chip saw grocery store actually bought different variety food taste good chip havent seen seemed different chip im trying eat healthier give thing enjoy eating chip one thing particular chip great alternative normally greesy fried potato chip taste like sweet potato apparently combination sweet potato corn still good highly recommended snacking alternative regular chip

5,Wellness Core Puppy Dry Food,"I spent HOURS researching dog food.  I had it down to Wolf Pup, Taste of Wild, and this Wellness Core.  WC was my last choice as I researched that some dogs can be allergic to chicken.  I asked the vet, and she said it's true, but she wouldn't say it's common.  She said to go with chicken and save the lamb and bison as alternatives IF she would become allergic.  So then WC became my #1 choice.  It's grain free which I liked.  So we picked up the food, picked up our new puppy and started the half and half with the dog food the breeder was giving.  After all the research I almost cried as I poured in the ""other brand"" (knowing how bad all the fillers/corn/garbage was in the other stuff).  So we only went two days with the mixing, then I went to straight WCore.  She did great (7 and half weeks at this point)!  Never had any digestion problems, never had any loose stools.  I am hoping for the miracle food that everyone is claiming that it will produce much better fur and low dander.  We've bathed her 3 times in one week (I know, a bit compulsive) and she has no skin problems.  She is a little over 8 lbs. now, and just moved up to about a cup a day.  So they do eat less than the typical dog food.  The ""other brand"" was recommending almost 2 cups while WC was right on track with what she was eating at 1 cup/ day (divided into thirds or fourths throughout the day).  So I feel a little better spending the extra money knowing that it's lasting me longer than the typical bag of ""other brand"" dog food.  Love that the ingredients are healthy!  The only hangup I had was a comment I had read that their dog didn't like it.  I wasn't spending sixty dollars to find out she didn't like it.  I called customer service and she explained I would have a money back guarantee.  So that sealed the deal.  Our lab mix loves it, and we haven't looked back.<br />Update:  She is now 9 weeks old and only needing a bath once a week.  She no longer has that ""dog smell"".  It has to be the food. :)",Positive,spent hour researching dog food wolf pup taste wild wellness core wc last choice researched dog allergic chicken asked vet said true wouldnt say common said go chicken save lamb bison alternative would become allergic wc became choice grain free liked picked food picked new puppy started half half dog food breeder giving research almost cried poured brand knowing bad fillerscorngarbage stuff went two day mixing went straight wcore great half week point never digestion problem never loose stool hoping miracle food everyone claiming produce much better fur low dander weve bathed time one week know bit compulsive skin problem little lb moved cup day eat less typical dog food brand recommending almost cup wc right track eating cup day divided third fourth throughout day feel little better spending extra money knowing lasting longer typical bag brand dog food love ingredient healthy hangup comment read dog didnt like wasnt spending sixty dollar find didnt like called customer service explained would money back guarantee sealed deal lab mix love havent looked backupdate week old needing bath week longer dog smell food

2,Don't waste your money,"This product is fairly expensive, for what you get. It would be fine if you had guests coming and you are not a wheatard, so you need something to feed them.<br /><br />Ingredient list: Brown rice flour, baking powder, vanilla bean powder, salt, baking soda, xanthan gum.<br /><br />Vanilla powder aside, anyone who is GF has these ingredients.<br /><br />I added quite a few things to it to help it out: eggs, olive oil, almond milk, a little sugar (it's not sweet), and a little tapioca flour.

5,A Top Favorite - Strong Coffee,"I love the variety of choices you get with the Keurig and this is another fine example.  My family tends towards the darker roasts and have settled on a few favorites.  We've been trying to make our way though most of the varieties and Jet Fuel has landed solidly in our top 5.<br /><br />This is a strong, flavorful cup of coffee.  We only use it on the largest cup size setting as it is too strong for smaller cups.  However, being strong should not be equated with tasting like burnt dirt.  There are some great flavors in this cup and a nice long smooth finish.  I love it when a sip of coffee lingers on the tongue for a few moments and makes you want to take another sip.  Jet Fuel meets the bill.<br /><br />Pros:<br />o strong dark brew<br />o nice flavors<br />o long smooth finish<br /><br />Cons:<br />o a bit too strong for smaller cup sizes<br /><br />Overall - highly recommended - a family favorite.",Positive,love variety choice get keurig another fine example family tends towards darker roast settled favorite weve trying make way though variety jet fuel landed solidly top strong flavorful cup coffee use largest cup size setting strong smaller cup however strong equated tasting like burnt dirt great flavor cup nice long smooth finish love sip coffee lingers tongue moment make want take another sip jet fuel meet billproso strong dark brewo nice flavorso long smooth finishconso bit strong smaller cup sizesoverall highly recommended family favorite

1,Beware of Soy Lecithin!,I was going to purchase this until I saw that it has Soy Lecithin in it. Soy is estrogenic and Soy Lecithin in particular is like the crap they scrape off the floor.

3,"Nice flavor, but might be too thick/chunky for babies new to textured foods.","My baby girl absolutely adores Sprout stage 1 and 2 pureed baby foods, so I was really looking forward to giving her Sprout stage 3 foods when she turned 8 months old and was ready for an introduction to textured solids.  The first time we tried this Sprout stage 3 Butternut Squash Mac & Cheese, my little-one gagged so hard that her eyes watered!  (And she also panicked a little ... very scary for Mom & Dad!)  I know that a bit of gagging is to be expected when introducing a baby to textured solids, but this was well beyond the norm.  I then tried some of the Mac & Cheese myself, and while it was certainly flavorful, it contained pretty large chunks of food, like whole pieces of elbow macaroni.  Plus, it was so thick that you could barely stir it with a spoon.  Definitely too much for my baby, who'd only had smooth purees up to that point.  Sprout is definitely the thickest and chunkiest of the organic stage 3 baby foods that I've tried.  The stage 3 training dinners from Plum Organics and Ella's Kitchen are textured, but they contain very small, soft bits of meat, vegetables and rice/pasta that were much easier for my baby to manage (i.e., little or no gagging).<br /><br />Once your baby is comfortable eating chunky textured solids, Sprout stage 3 baby foods are bound to become a favorite.  The Mac & Cheese (and the other flavors) are very tasty and well-seasoned, minus the added salt and sugar, which babies don't need.  And Sprout baby food is certified organic to boot.  Therefore, I'll be storing these stage 3 pouches in the back of my pantry for a few weeks until my baby girl is ready for them.<br /><br />For advanced textured solid-eaters: A<br />For newbies: C",Neutral,baby girl absolutely adores sprout stage pureed baby food really looking forward giving sprout stage food turned month old ready introduction textured solid first time tried sprout stage butternut squash mac cheese littleone gagged hard eye watered also panicked little scary mom dad know bit gagging expected introducing baby textured solid well beyond norm tried mac cheese certainly flavorful contained pretty large chunk food like whole piece elbow macaroni plus thick could barely stir spoon definitely much baby whod smooth puree point sprout definitely thickest chunkiest organic stage baby food ive tried stage training dinner plum organic ellas kitchen textured contain small soft bit meat vegetable ricepasta much easier baby manage ie little gaggingonce baby comfortable eating chunky textured solid sprout stage baby food bound become favorite mac cheese flavor tasty wellseasoned minus added salt sugar baby dont need sprout baby food certified organic boot therefore ill storing stage pouch back pantry week baby girl ready themfor advanced textured solideaters afor newbie c

5,Exactly what I was looking for!,"This Chai hits the spot perfectly and for a great cost combined with the simplicity of only needing to add water.  Yes, I will admit it is not as smooth as a Starbucks Chai Latte if you just make it like I do with nothing but hot water and no frother, etc.  However, for how easy it is to make, how cheap it is overall, and how quickly Amazon gets this to me, I will take this any day of the week.  I have saved soooo much money already from drinking this instead of my daily habit of visiting Starbucks previously.<br /><br />For those wary of buying in bulk like this, it is well worth it, and trust me you will drink it.  I have gone through 4 cans already and am about to order my next 2 cans.  I keep one at home, and one at work.  Never know when you need that Chai fix ;).  The flavor is perfect for me; it has the right amount of spices and a pretty creamy taste for being a powder mix (much better than most hot chocolate/etc mixes in terms of smoothness).  I am tempted to try the other varieties that Big Train sells as well now... like Vanilla.<br /><br />Overall, I am very impressed with this product, and will continue to order it as long as they sell it.  5 Stars, 2 Thumbs Up!",Positive,chai hit spot perfectly great cost combined simplicity needing add water yes admit smooth starbucks chai latte make like nothing hot water frother etc however easy make cheap overall quickly amazon get take day week saved soooo much money already drinking instead daily habit visiting starbucks previouslyfor wary buying bulk like well worth trust drink gone can already order next can keep one home one work never know need chai fix flavor perfect right amount spice pretty creamy taste powder mix much better hot chocolateetc mix term smoothness tempted try variety big train sell well like vanillaoverall impressed product continue order long sell star thumb

5,Favorite Nutritional Yeast,"Bob's Red Mill is my absolute favorite brand of nutritional yeast. I've even been to the factory outlet in Oregon! Some nutritional yeast is small flake and doesn't have the same texture as the large flake version. Some is light colored and appears like it's lost its nutrients and flavor.<br /><br />I use nutritional yeast on virtually everything, and we even have a little shaker of it on the dinner table. It's amazing on popcorn with a little salt and dill, I love it in pestos instead of cheese, it flavors up any vegan cheeses you are making (great for vegan macaroni-n-cheese), and works well in soups and stews.<br /><br />The best part is that it's actually nutritious. If you're a vegan, it gives you a boost of vitamin b12 so you don't have to take a vitamin supplement.<br /><br />I order from Amazon and use subscribe and save, which is the best deal available for it.",Positive,bob red mill absolute favorite brand nutritional yeast ive even factory outlet oregon nutritional yeast small flake doesnt texture large flake version light colored appears like lost nutrient flavori use nutritional yeast virtually everything even little shaker dinner table amazing popcorn little salt dill love pesto instead cheese flavor vegan cheese making great vegan macaronincheese work well soup stewsthe best part actually nutritious youre vegan give boost vitamin b dont take vitamin supplementi order amazon use subscribe save best deal available
1,Awful,"For starters this lid does not fit.  It is supposed to be held on by two little ""bumps"" on the edge of the lid but they are not flared out far enough.  The end result is that the lid easily falls off.<br /><br />Further, the quality of the ceramic glaze is terrible.  There are several spots on my piece where the glaze was missed and the raw porcelain shows through.<br /><br />Contrary to other reviewers, the water drips though WAY too fast.  When i make a single cup the water is fully through the cone in less than 30 seconds.  This is far too fast given that coffee should ideally steep in the water for 1.5 to 2 minutes.<br /><br />The handles are also thin and flimsy.  They look like they would easily snap off.  Lastly, this item is made in China so I'm concerned about the lead content of the glaze used.  Given the shoddy overall quality I would not be surprised if they were also careless about what went into the glaze materials.  Do yourself a favor and find something made in Japan.",Negative,starter lid fit supposed held two little bump edge lid flared far enough end result lid easily fall offfurther quality ceramic glaze terrible several spot piece glaze missed raw porcelain show throughcontrary reviewer water drip though way fast make single cup water fully cone less second far fast given coffee ideally steep water minutesthe handle also thin flimsy look like would easily snap lastly item made china im concerned lead content glaze used given shoddy overall quality would surprised also careless went glaze material favor find something made japan

5,Where has this been all my life?,"Since I spend most of my week alone, opening a big box of cereal is such a waste.  The cereal would always go bad before I could eat it all.  This doesn't happen with these containers.<br /><br />I love these individual serving sizes because they also aid in calorie counting and at 80-110 calories, they are low in calories.  I carry around one of the fruit loops packages in my backpack, just as a great snack.<br /><br />I do want to warn though, that Amazon shipped them to me in a single box and about 20 of the containers arrived opened inside the box because the outer box was a little damaged, but being the great company they are, Amazon promptly shipped another box ""free of charge"" and allowed me to keep the ones from the original shipment that made it here okay.

5,As good as bagged can get,"Of course no bagged tea can ever be the ""best tea ever"", but in the realm of bagged, this tea is about the best you could ever ask for.<br /><br />Twinings Everyday is just that- a tea that's perfect every day of the week. It's a light black tea, with a nice easy flavor that has just a pinch of citrus. Steep it more lightly and you get an almost white tea flavor, longer to go darker. The only reason any tea enthusiast should be disappointed is if they prefer especially strong brews. My father-in-law is the type that would eat the leaves if he could, so he'd have to use extra bags to make the sort of insanely strong brew he prefers. Then again, that's why it comes in boxes of eighty.<br /><br />The actual flavor is perfectly balanced, and suits whatever bells and whistles you want to tack on. If you want to drink it as is, it's wonderful. It goes perfect with lemon, or with milk, and I've found it's also wonderful with honey and sugar. In short, this tea suits whatever you're in the mood for.<br /><br />I recommend this tea enthusiastically. I wound up picking up a box on clearance, and couldn't be happier. If you love tea, this is the perfect default to keep at hand when you can't decide which specialty brew to have. If you've never really gotten into tea, this is the pefect blend to learn what the fuss is about. This tea does lend itself more to afternoon and blending with milk or sweeteners, but it's fine in any situation.",Positive,course bagged tea ever best tea ever realm bagged tea best could ever ask fortwinings everyday tea thats perfect every day week light black tea nice easy flavor pinch citrus steep lightly get almost white tea flavor longer go darker reason tea enthusiast disappointed prefer especially strong brew fatherinlaw type would eat leaf could hed use extra bag make sort insanely strong brew prefers thats come box eightythe actual flavor perfectly balanced suit whatever bell whistle want tack want drink wonderful go perfect lemon milk ive found also wonderful honey sugar short tea suit whatever youre mood fori recommend tea enthusiastically wound picking box clearance couldnt happier love tea perfect default keep hand cant decide specialty brew youve never really gotten tea pefect blend learn fuss tea lend afternoon blending milk sweetener fine situation

5,"Pricey, but well worth it","There is a feline diabetes epidemic out there.  My cat was self-feeding dry food (Purina Urinary Tract Health) which has a huge proportion of cereal carbs.  When she developed diabetes the vet advised adding Science Prescription Diet DM wet canned foot to augment the dry.  She needed less and less insulin and finally we were told she didn't need it at all. Still letting her self-feed the Purina dry foot while feeding her the wet canned, she had a relapse.  I decided to toss the Purina and just feed her the wet food and she's been fine for almost a year now.  I'm hoping she'll remain diabetes-free for the rest of her life.<br /><br />The Wellness food, labeled ""Core,"" is very low carb and both my cats love it!  It contains a lot of water (""no more than 78%"" is what the label says -- kinda expensive way to keep your cats in water ;)<br /><br />I justify the expense by accepting that my cat would be needing $100 vials of insulin, plus frequent vet checks of her blood. Instead I'm spending the money on food.<br /><br />As a side note, our other cat without diabetes loves this food, too.  She had urologic problems, was always licking herself, and used to smell really, really bad. She's doing super now and I attribute it to the wet, cereal-free food.<br /><br />I highly recommend working with your vet to wean your cat off dry cereal foods, especially if they're diabetic.

Our older Pug before was on a different brand and we recently put him on this now too and his coat transformed! :) The only reason I give this food 4 stars is because it gives our dogs HORRIBLE gas.

We may be switching to another flavor of Earthborn because of this, but either way we are sticking with Earthborn!<br /><br />*update* after a couple weeks of daily stink episodes with the Pugs they have calmed down a lot and I feel as if the food is no longer effecting them in that way :) We did give them half their old food/half new food for most of that time so maybe that played a role too, so in other words...

5,Best Turkey Jerky that I've tried,"I've tried some options on amazon.com such as Jack Link's Turkey Jerky and Turkey Nuggets, Snackmasters Range Brown Turkey Jerky, Golden Valley Natural Turkey Jerky, among others from various retail outlets. Totally, I have had ~7 different brands of turkey jerky and ~8 of the beef variety .  Among turkey, Oberto is my favorite by far.<br /><br />Given that jerky is made by a dehydration process, dryness is inherent to jerky as a food.  Also, turkey is a dryer meat than beef (the most common jerky) and I've found turkey jerky to be, on average, dryer than beef jerky.  I prefer my jerky relatively moist.<br /><br />Oberto Turkey Jerky is by far the most moist jerky I've had (aside from the Oberto Pork brand). The package usually has very large strips that hold their water content for greater lengths of time.  The other brands I've tried are broken into small pieces and are very chewy & dry in comparison.

5,Can't make them this good at home!!,"I'm very particular about what I feed my dogs. I often make my own ""canned/wet"" food and treats at home to ensure the quality and safety of the food I'm feeding my dogs. After looking at the ingredients in these biscuits and checking out the price when purchased in the 12 pound box, I realized I could not make biscuits of this quality at home for this price. My dogs really love these biscuits, and I feel good about the quality of this product. I also love that I can divide these biscuits into various sizes, as I have dogs that range from 6 lbs to 130 lbs. Even with 5 dogs this 12 lb box lasts a long time, and it is packaged in 3 heavy zipper bags, so you don't open all 12 lbs at once and they stay fresh.

I've used the oil on pasta (it has directions to make a salad dressing on the bottle) and I like the flavor a lot. The flavor is kind of a warm, rich, nutty kind of flavor. What I bought the product for was not for food though. I bought it for my read dry skin on my face. I got really bad sunburn last summer on my face and it's been flaking ever since on my cheeks. So, I squirt a little bit on a sock and rub my face with it! The flakes of skin come right off and it helps my skin. It hasn't given me acne and this oil miraculously does NOT clog pores. I shaved my head and gave myself a mohawk but I noticed I had really bad dry scalp on the sides and it was disgusting. I treated my head with this stuff for about a week and now it doesn't have any flakes and is completely healed... my face is being stubborn though... the sun really cooked it last summer.

I'll admit we may let our tea steep a little longer than average but we've always done that and haven't noticed any changes in the tea.<br /><br />When we make ice tea, which is often seeing as how we live in the South, we use Lipton's Ice Tea blend in the larger bags instead of the smaller bags used here.

I especially like their ice tea and used to drink a lot of the regular, full sugar variety until I decided to do something about my weight. (The card from the scale at the drug store said, ""beware of ivory poachers"". - I got my shoes shined, I had to take the guy's word for it.)<br /><br />The lemon flavor seems to hide the artificial sweetner taste and I have been drinking it for a few months without really missing the one with real sugar.<br /><br />The 16 oz. size works perfectly for me - a 12 oz. can of soda isn't enough but 2 cans, is a little too much.<br /><br />Overall, it's a good summer drink.

It tastes like a great apple cider you'd get from your local farm. Pours cloudy, not clear. Watch the price here though. I usually take a 20% off coupon into bed bath and beyond for my k cups.

4,Good cold. Dubious marketing claims,"This is marketed the same way that toothpaste is (""doctor recommended""), which for me, has the opposite effect on credibility. Strangely, this product does not have the usual FDA disclaimer that I've seen on other products (""This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA"").<br /><br />Evaluating this water just as a water, apart from the numerous health benefit claims, it's good. When at room temperature, the taste is a bit strange and off-putting. When refrigerated and served cold, it is very refreshing and clean tasting. Not sure what ""Best available pH at 9.5"" means.. This statement does not make sense. pH is a measurement of acidity or alkalinity, on a scale of 0-14 (0 being a strong acid, 14 being a strong base). Normal water is neutral at 7. ""Hydrates better"" than what? What are we comparing this to? Hydrates better than an English muffin? Yes, it certainly does!<br /><br />Most of the other sales bullet points are standard and hardly worth mentioning.. Plastic is type 1 PETE and can be easily recycled, but most beverage bottles are made of #1 or #2. I'm not a fan of bottling water and the claims of reducing carbon footprint are bogus. These bottles have to be shipped across the country, using trucks and airplanes, which is not carbon neutral.

Only one little problem, I did a taste test with this up against Kroeger store brand coffee a generic.<br /><br />This was almost a dead tie. the flavor and density was comparable with the only obvious difference being that the finer ground of the Melitta meant that it was less acidic and didn't upset my stomach as much after my 4th cup.

I read all the reviews and gave it a try, but I find there is a nasty and bitter taste to it that lingers long after it is gone - much like the taste of artificial sweeteners for me.  I realize that it may just be me - I also can not tolerate the taste of any diet drink for the same reason, so take this review for what it is - my opinion.<br /><br />I also, however, found it very difficult to mix, and found it had a waxy consistency which I found very unpleasant.

5,Mild but not Bland or Tasteless,"Currently, this is the only K-Cup 50 pack listed as ""mild"" on Amazon. I was expecting something with only a little flavor and bitterness, but these K-Cups surprised me. They're not as strong as the bold or extra bold flavors, but the difference is reasonably subtle. They're certainly not bland or tasteless. Also, they do taste to me a little sweet and smoky - just as they are described above.<br /><br />A note about packaging: when I bought a Coffee People 50 pack from Amazon, the K-Cups came in only one box - a thick, corrugated cardboard Coffee People box. Amazon just stuck the mailing labels on the box and gave it to USPS.

5,This salt will change your life,"Those searching high and low for salt that will change their life can end their journey with Murray River Sea Salt.<br /><br />I first stumbled on this salt at a local outlet of a cultlike nationwide chain store that pretends to sell only the highest quality foods but also happily lends its imprimatur to made-in-China foods that sometimes turn out to be tainted.  But, ignoring other controversies associated with that store, one day a package of this salt sold by that store stirred my interest which led to the salt completing the last step of its long and probably ecologically-unsound trip from Australia to my kitchen.<br /><br />Here's the thing about Murray River salt:  Its pinkish flakes are fragile and crumble easily in your fingers.  It also seems to dissolve almost immediately on contact with food.  This is in sharp contrast to every other salt I've tried.  We currently have 6 or 8 other kinds of coarse-crystal salt in the house.  None of them can be crushed in your fingers.  They remain large, hard chunks of salt.  Yes, they represent other flavors than the Murray River salt, but there is something gentle and friendly about this salt.  I have a totally-unsubstantiated theory that this salt is better for your body than the hardened crystals of other salts.<br /><br />Our household keeps Murray River salt in a salt cellar (in our case a small lidded wooden bowl) from which it is pinched with the fingers (instead of using the traditional tiny spoon) and crumbled directly onto food on the plate.  For sanitary reasons, only a small amount of the salt at a time is put in the bowl.  That way the bowl gets cleaned frequently.  Frequent cleaning seems like a necessity when fingers, even washed ones, are the tools of choice for dispensing the salt.  Words to the wise: If you invite nose-pickers to your table, provide a salt shaker and hide the Murray River stuff till they've left.  If you have small children in your home, wait until they are grown and are draining your bank account at the safe distance of some far-off college before purchasing and placing this salt on your table.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned that they use this as a finishing salt.  Our household concurs.  We rarely if ever add this salt to anything in the cooking process.  We keep Kosher salt and a couple of sea salts for most larger-salt-use cooking needs, like baking (which frankly seems like the only time one should add much salt to the cooking process).  But this is the good stuff for your table and the food you serve on it.<br /><br />The chain store mentioned above no longer carries this salt so Amazon is the logical alternative.<br /><br />Note that I purchased a 1lb bag, which keeps well because I live in a desert.  But next time I'll probably purchase a multi-pack of the smallest bags for a small amount more per unit weight in exchange for the convenience of having smaller packages.",Positive,searching high low salt change life end journey murray river sea salti first stumbled salt local outlet cultlike nationwide chain store pretend sell highest quality food also happily lends imprimatur madeinchina food sometimes turn tainted ignoring controversy associated store one day package salt sold store stirred interest led salt completing last step long probably ecologicallyunsound trip australia kitchenheres thing murray river salt pinkish flake fragile crumble easily finger also seems dissolve almost immediately contact food sharp contrast every salt ive tried currently kind coarsecrystal salt house none crushed finger remain large hard chunk salt yes represent flavor murray river salt something gentle friendly salt totallyunsubstantiated theory salt better body hardened crystal saltsour household keep murray river salt salt cellar case small lidded wooden bowl pinched finger instead using traditional tiny spoon crumbled directly onto food plate sanitary reason small amount salt time put bowl way bowl get cleaned frequently frequent cleaning seems like necessity finger even washed one tool choice dispensing salt word wise invite nosepickers table provide salt shaker hide murray river stuff till theyve left small child home wait grown draining bank account safe distance faroff college purchasing placing salt tableanother reviewer mentioned use finishing salt household concurs rarely ever add salt anything cooking process keep kosher salt couple sea salt largersaltuse cooking need like baking frankly seems like time one add much salt cooking process good stuff table food serve itthe chain store mentioned longer carry salt amazon logical alternativenote purchased lb bag keep well live desert next time ill probably purchase multipack smallest bag small amount per unit weight exchange convenience smaller package

4,"Good, but not quite the Best","I don't think I've had steel cut oats that I could describe as ""bad"", but I have to say that these don't quite rise to the level of McCann's.  The Arrowhead product is lots, cheaper, however, so overall it might be a better bet unless you want the absolute best.<br /><br />The differences are subtle.  For some reason I get a larger volume of cooked outs from 1 cup of McCann's than I do from Arrowhead, and the McCann's has a more of the distinctive ""nutty"" flavor that makes steel cut oats so delicious.<br /><br />The two products actually have different cooking instructions.  McCann's calls for 30 minutes of cooking once the oats are put into boiling water.  Arrowhead calls for 12 minutes of cooking after the oats are put into cold water and brought to a boil.  Cooked that way the Arrowhead oats are markedly inferior, but cooked the McCann's way they get much better.<br /><br />I'm still on a quest to find oats as good as I had in England at a couple of fancy places in London.

As I figured each 16 ounce bag comes to about $10.50 each I myself purchased four of those bags.  And of course let's not forget the shipping that is not included.

4,Pretty Close,"While not exactly like eggs it is pretty darn close. The main difference between these and eggs I would say is the consistency.

OvaEasy is very consistent both in color and texture, real eggs however are not.<br /><br />Flavor wise they are pretty darn close to real eggs. If you couldn't tell the difference between the texture then you probably wouldn't know the difference. A nice easy measuring spoon of sorts would be nice for cooking purposes so you could easily calculate how many eggs you were making, but I also wonder how accurate their measurement per egg is as well as it does seem a little on the small side.<br /><br />I have not attempted any baking with this yet, but imagine it will work just like regular eggs given how they cook up directly in a pan. The real trick here is going to be in measuring out the correct amount of egg.

4,Simple Goodness,"Baby Gourmet promises to bring organic goodness to baby food without added sugar, salt, dairy,eggs or nuts.  Additionally it is free of fillers, thickeners and gluten.  The packaging is BHA free but not recyclable. The food is packaged in convenient pouches with a plastic screw top.  This design makes it easy for taking one the go as well as for storing the unused portion.  (Should be refrigerated after opening) But the litmus test of any food is the flavor.<br /><br />This food can be served either warmed or cooled. (Package is not microwaable.)  I sampled it both ways.  Cold it tastes like a not very sweet apple sauce.  The greens, especially broccoli, come through more when it is heated,but are not overwhelming.  It is pureed and smooth. The taste isw very mild. My friend's two babies seemed to enjoy it both warm and cool.  I also gave some to a relative who has suffered a stroke.  She has difficulty eating and has lost her taste for veggies.  This was palatable and easy for her to swallow.  I could see giving it to ailing adults or older children as well as utilizing for babies.<br /><br />I applaud this company for using organic, healthier ingredients in baby food.  It is costly but an early investment in a baby's health is one with lifelong benefits.  The pouches are perfect for babies on the go and this is an easy way to intorduce greens into the diet.",Positive,baby gourmet promise bring organic goodness baby food without added sugar salt dairyeggs nut additionally free filler thickener gluten packaging bha free recyclable food packaged convenient pouch plastic screw top design make easy taking one go well storing unused portion refrigerated opening litmus test food flavorthis food served either warmed cooled package microwaable sampled way cold taste like sweet apple sauce green especially broccoli come heatedbut overwhelming pureed smooth taste isw mild friend two baby seemed enjoy warm cool also gave relative suffered stroke difficulty eating lost taste veggie palatable easy swallow could see giving ailing adult older child well utilizing babiesi applaud company using organic healthier ingredient baby food costly early investment baby health one lifelong benefit pouch perfect baby go easy way intorduce green diet

3,Flawed design,"I loved the idea of popcorn that would pop in its own bowl. I gave it a try tonight as I settled in to watch a movie. The first thing I noticed as it popped was that the sides of the bag were a red see through type of material so you could see the popcorn popping. Not sure if that's needed but I liked it so it was a plus. The ""bowl"" was disappointing though. Essentially, its just a bag of popcorn that you place on it's side, rip the side off & you eat the popcorn this way so you have a wide opening to eat from. Problem is, where you tear the side off doesn't work well. I followed the directions and found the area that is supposed to rip off didn't go smoothly & part of it didn't tear where it should & I ended up having to go back & rip more areas off, etc. Perhaps with practice you can get it right but it was a little underwhelming. The popcorn was a little bland also. Great idea but poor design. Hopefully someone will improve on it.",Neutral,loved idea popcorn would pop bowl gave try tonight settled watch movie first thing noticed popped side bag red see type material could see popcorn popping sure thats needed liked plus bowl disappointing though essentially bag popcorn place side rip side eat popcorn way wide opening eat problem tear side doesnt work well followed direction found area supposed rip didnt go smoothly part didnt tear ended go back rip area etc perhaps practice get right little underwhelming popcorn little bland also great idea poor design hopefully someone improve
5,Strong cup of coffee. I deal for making iced coffee.,"What type of coffee drinker am I?<br />In our Cuisinart coffee maker my wife and I use 1.5 tablespoons of Dunkin Donuts coffee per 6 oz of water so we like our coffee pretty strong. However, neither one of us goes out of our way to get Starbucks because we don't like the taste for some reason. If Starbucks is considered bitter, that is probably why.<br /><br />Review.<br />I would consider this coffee bold yet not bitter. It's definitely full flavored yet not over powering. Maybe that is what ""Crema e Gusto"" is specifying. The ratio of coffee to water for a Dunkin Donuts drinker is about 3/4 of a table spoon to 6oz of water. I accredit the smaller ratio to how finely ground the coffee is rather than overall strength.<br /><br />I drink iced coffee in the summer so even though it is January I had to try it. This coffee is IDEAL for making iced coffee because you can make it at 1.5 table spoons to 6oz of water and the taste is not effected by a little bit of ice melting. I can not stress enough how good this coffee is iced!<br /><br />I am defiantly enjoying the LavAzza and may try other varieties to make hot coffee but this is my go to for iced coffee from now on!",Positive,type coffee drinker iin cuisinart coffee maker wife use tablespoon dunkin donut coffee per oz water like coffee pretty strong however neither one u go way get starbucks dont like taste reason starbucks considered bitter probably whyreviewi would consider coffee bold yet bitter definitely full flavored yet powering maybe crema e gusto specifying ratio coffee water dunkin donut drinker table spoon oz water accredit smaller ratio finely ground coffee rather overall strengthi drink iced coffee summer even though january try coffee ideal making iced coffee make table spoon oz water taste effected little bit ice melting stress enough good coffee icedi defiantly enjoying lavazza may try variety make hot coffee go iced coffee

I call it guilt-free microwave popcorn.",Positive,microwave popcorn claiming low fatcalorie compare smart balance brand one lowest calorie taste like movie theatre butter popcorn well still good get used skipping butter call guiltfree microwave popcorn
5,Zoey loves them!,"I've heard how stinky tripe can be, but these tripe treats have about the same ""stinkiness"" level as the dried beef lung that I've given to my little sheltie.  Not too bad.  Just in case, I do give these treats to my 30 lb sheltie on her ""meal blanket"" to keep any tripe bits or tripe-scented drool off the carpet, because my dog would lick the carpet for days.  (When I gave these to her on our wood deck, she licked the deck for a few minutes afterward until I pulled her away.... ow, tongue splinters!)<br /><br />So, Zoey gives these treats two paws up.  It takes her about 2 or 3 minutes to eat an entire treat (she chews her food thoroughly, she's not a gulper).  I give her one treat a day, and it hasn't adversely affected her stools at all.  Her tummy accepted it into her diet quite readily.<br /><br />There were 15 treats in my 5 oz bag, each 5-6"" long.  A couple were thin (a little thicker than a pencil), but most are quite thick, at least as big around as my thumb.<br /><br />Sitstay.com is a great store, I've always had stellar service from them.",Positive,ive heard stinky tripe tripe treat stinkiness level dried beef lung ive given little sheltie bad case give treat lb sheltie meal blanket keep tripe bit tripescented drool carpet dog would lick carpet day gave wood deck licked deck minute afterward pulled away ow tongue splintersso zoey give treat two paw take minute eat entire treat chew food thoroughly shes gulper give one treat day hasnt adversely affected stool tummy accepted diet quite readilythere treat oz bag long couple thin little thicker pencil quite thick least big around thumbsitstaycom great store ive always stellar service
4,Yummy Sugary Fiber,"""Ingredients you can see & prounounce...""  Okay, what exactly is amaranth and quinoa?  I've ridden a camel, been to a state fair and even penetrated Japanese prime ministerial security, but I can't say that I know what this stuff is.<br /><br />From the product page, it appears that the clusters are supposed to be little bite-size globs of vanilla blueberry goodness.  Unfortunately, when mine arrived in the Amazon.com book mailer, I only had two little cluster-like bits.  The rest was smashed and separated into bird seed.  I figure that clusters of this stuff would be pretty good, and make it a lot easier to eat this stuff ""on-the-go!"" as the package copy boldly exhorts.<br /><br />To its credit, the package opened right away, with the first pull, right along the top edge.  You'd be surprised how many packages can't get this right, like tortillas, beef jerky and lunch meat.  So, they had an advantage already.<br /><br />First came the sniff test: how does this stuff smell?  In general, it's kind of an industrial-neutral.  There is no cloying smell of artificial blueberry, which I was relieved not to smell.  There is the distinct and powerful scent of nothing but grain and seed, not salty or spicy, nor sugary sweet.  So far, the ingredients were in step with the package's copy.  There seemed to be just a hint of factory chemicals for the purposes of crunch or freshness or whatever.  I'm not saying that this is in the product, just that I seemed to discern that smell.<br /><br />So, I tried a third of this package in on-the-go mode, right out of the package.  Good stuff.  This would be a great product to bring along on a hike or a campout.  But, the bag's small size would make it awfully hard to share with any more than just a couple of people.  The taste was great, with very clear natural sweetness.  Very crunchy, but not that unpleasant brittle crunchiness you get with some foods.<br /><br />I then tried a third of the package in a little bit of milk, and it was just as good.  It stayed very crunchy for a good long time, all the way through eating it.  The density of it caused most of the product to sink to the bottom, so I had to bottom-feed with my spoon to get it all.<br /><br />Then I put the remaining third into some milk again, and sprinkled some <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000KOWJQE"">Equal</a> over the top.  Yeah, it was considerably sweeter, maybe even a little too much so.  Recommendation: do not sweeten this product any further.  Real sugar would make this stuff way too sweet.<br /><br />Taste.  The taste is in keeping with the smell, very grainy.  The taste of the blueberries is very subtle, as is the vanilla.  I could taste both, but it was subdued.  Overall, the taste was quite good.  Good texture, too.<br /><br />Nutrition.  Man, you're getting a lot of fiber here.  And there is a lot that this product doesn't have, as the package's front makes clear, like saturated fat, trans fats, cholesterol, etc.  That's pretty good.  But you're also not getting a lot of calcium, iron, or any Vitamin A or C.  While the package's front says there are no ""refined sugars"" in the product, the listed ingredients include official stand-ins/euphemisms for ""sugar,"" like evaporated cane juice.  The product's serving size is a miniscule 1/3 of a cup, and this comes in at 120 calories.  So, a single package, which I ate for dinner, comes in at close to 1300 calories.  Great energy food, but not great for a Saturday morning cereal bender in front of the Cartoon Network.<br /><br />Price.  The unit price comes out to be more than $5/bag.  That's something like more than a dollar more than a big box of cereal (truth be told, the big boxes come out to about 13 oz, and this product comes in at 11 oz).  So, you'll get considerably more product for your money with regular boxed cereal.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is a good product, and I enjoyed it.  The taste and texture is good.  But, like <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00317EA46"">Kashi</a> cereals, it's a bit too concentrated and a bit too spendy.",Positive,ingredient see prounounce okay exactly amaranth quinoa ive ridden camel state fair even penetrated japanese prime ministerial security cant say know stuff isfrom product page appears cluster supposed little bitesize glob vanilla blueberry goodness unfortunately mine arrived amazoncom book mailer two little clusterlike bit rest smashed separated bird seed figure cluster stuff would pretty good make lot easier eat stuff onthego package copy boldly exhortsto credit package opened right away first pull right along top edge youd surprised many package cant get right like tortilla beef jerky lunch meat advantage alreadyfirst came sniff test stuff smell general kind industrialneutral cloying smell artificial blueberry relieved smell distinct powerful scent nothing grain seed salty spicy sugary sweet far ingredient step package copy seemed hint factory chemical purpose crunch freshness whatever im saying product seemed discern smellso tried third package onthego mode right package good stuff would great product bring along hike campout bag small size would make awfully hard share couple people taste great clear natural sweetness crunchy unpleasant brittle crunchiness get foodsi tried third package little bit milk good stayed crunchy good long time way eating density caused product sink bottom bottomfeed spoon get allthen put remaining third milk sprinkled equal top yeah considerably sweeter maybe even little much recommendation sweeten product real sugar would make stuff way sweettaste taste keeping smell grainy taste blueberry subtle vanilla could taste subdued overall taste quite good good texture toonutrition man youre getting lot fiber lot product doesnt package front make clear like saturated fat trans fat cholesterol etc thats pretty good youre also getting lot calcium iron vitamin c package front say refined sugar product listed ingredient include official standinseuphemisms sugar like evaporated cane juice product serving size miniscule cup come calorie single package ate dinner come close calorie great energy food great saturday morning cereal bender front cartoon networkprice unit price come bag thats something like dollar big box cereal truth told big box come oz product come oz youll get considerably product money regular boxed cerealbottom line good product enjoyed taste texture good like kashi cereal bit concentrated bit spendy
3,Misleading and far too sweet,"I love tea.  Iced tea, hot tea, green tea, black tea, all kinds.  I was excited to try this product because I am always short on time and thought a powdered, just add water mix would be great.  One major problem, this ""tea"" has zero tea flavor.  It also claims to be ""sweetened with honey"" but it is actually sweetened with sucralose in addition to ""honey granules"".  Because of this, it has a very strong ""diet"" aftertaste, something I am not fond of at all.  Overall the drink was far too sweet for my liking even though I made it with 20oz of water instead of the 16 recommended.  I was really disappointed by this product.  I also feel the packaging is hugely misleading.  It says, and I quote; ""Sweetened with honey"" with no mention of the sucralose.  It does mention ""no aspartame"" but fails to mention it's other source of sweetness.  The ingredients are as follows: Honey granules (sugar, honey), Citric acid, green tea powder, sucralose, malodextrin, hibiscus extract, natural flavor, and Beta carotene for color.  As far as powdered diet drinks go, this one would be low on my list.  Even drinks like Crystal light do not have this strong of a diet aftertaste.",Neutral,love tea iced tea hot tea green tea black tea kind excited try product always short time thought powdered add water mix would great one major problem tea zero tea flavor also claim sweetened honey actually sweetened sucralose addition honey granule strong diet aftertaste something fond overall drink far sweet liking even though made oz water instead recommended really disappointed product also feel packaging hugely misleading say quote sweetened honey mention sucralose mention aspartame fails mention source sweetness ingredient follows honey granule sugar honey citric acid green tea powder sucralose malodextrin hibiscus extract natural flavor beta carotene color far powdered diet drink go one would low list even drink like crystal light strong diet aftertaste

5,EXCELLENT LIMITED INGREDIENT FOODS,"I have two cockers, one of which is getting older. She developed blisters and spotting on her usually beautiful coat.

After months of testing, meds and specialties, including cooking her special diet,with nothing working,I decided to try a different approach and came across this dog food. Within a few weeks her itching had completely stopped, and her coat was growing back like silk. They liked every type of the sweet potato and chicken, fish, duck. With the fish and chicken being their favorite. No nasty food smells as others have reported. Have also purchased the same in the biscuits and they love those also, which surprised me. Have used the meat rolls in the duck and beef, loved those also. So this is the new way of life for us now. And when you break down the price for the larger bag as opposed to the Pedigree, etc, it comes out pretty good price wise. The vet bill alone was killing me anyway. The smaller bags will eat away at your wallet if you go thru dog food quickly. I bought those only as a try out. Their stools are solid, although I do not notice less waste as some report.

But I read the other review and decided to give it a try.  They are so chewy that I could not bite off a piece. They have to be torn off with your teeth. Then there is the flavor or more accurately the lack of flavor. I guess with a good imagination, they might be said to taste like peaches, but they are pretty much tasteless.

5,Best tasting coconut water I have found!,"I have tried every brand of coconut water that health food stores carry, and this is, by far, my favorite.  The pineapple flavor does not overwhelm the coconut or vice versa. I also like the tetra pack with the screw on top- it is much more convenient than the smaller 11 oz size which you cannot reseal.

However, you must love bold coffee.  This is not for coffee whimps.  I did not find it bitter or burned-tasting, as I have read in other reviews.

Even my husband, who can sometimes be as picky as a kid, didn't notice a difference.  We've been eating the whole grain version and the noodles in those boxes come out a bit firmer.  But even the texture change was pretty subtle.  As I said, none of my family could tell.<br /><br />On the other hand, I couldn't really give it five stars because the neon cheese is still neon cheese.  I stir in about a half a cup of shredded cheese whenever I make it and that really improves the cheese flavor, in my opinion.",Positive,look like macaroni cheese youve eatig year veggie hidden noodle didnt taste difference served family without telling four kid age three usualy eat mac cheese ate without comment even husband sometimes picky kid didnt notice difference weve eating whole grain version noodle box come bit firmer even texture change pretty subtle said none family could tellon hand couldnt really give five star neon cheese still neon cheese stir half cup shredded cheese whenever make really improves cheese flavor opinion

There are some preservatives added to increase shelf life, but they make up a very small percentage of the overall treat.  The air we breathe probably contains more dangerous 'additives' than a twinkie.

4,Good results but contains soy,"I received Hill's Science Diet Ideal Balance Dog Food to try as a BzzAgent.  I'm feeding this to my terrier as he tends to show the results to changes in his diet quicker than my Corgi or Belgian Sheepdog.  I've been a dog mom for more than 20 years, including participating in dog sports such as sled dog running, agility and dog shows.  Proper nutrition is vital to dogs' health and ability to participate in things they love to do.  While I currently don't do these activities with my dogs, I still am very picky about what they eat.<br /><br />When I received my BzzKit, a 4lb bag of Hill's Science Diet, Ideal Balance Dog Food, I checked the ingredients.  The first listed is chicken (good!) followed by brown rice and whole grain wheat (not as good as a meat ingredient, but better than it being corn).  Next is cracked pearl barley, soybean meal and chicken meal.  I have to admit I paused at the soybean meal.  In my experience, soy has not been a positive addition to dog food.  I find that foods that contain it result in looser stools of greater volume, and the dog's overall condition is not as high as one fed a food without soy.  It's an inexpensive ingredient that is associated with ""filler"" in the dog community.  I was curious to see how my terrier would handle and fare on this food. 3 stars for only one meat ingredient in the first 5 ingredients, and for the inclusion of soy.<br /><br />Rex, my terrier, became immediately interested when I opened the bag.  He was VERY anxious to see what was in there, so the smell must have been very enticing.  He's not a picky eater, so I anticipated he'd like the Ideal Balance, but didn't anticipate how eager he was to get it!  I slowly, over the course of days, switched him to Ideal Balance from his previous food (to reduce stomach upset from a diet change), and found he ate the Ideal Balance nuggets first before cleaning his bowl.  It may be because it was new and novel, but it may have been because he liked it better.  He's a dog...he couldn't tell me.  He seems to like it so much that I can even use Ideal Balance as a training treat.  5 Stars for taste.<br /><br />Rex has been eating Ideal Balance for a couple of weeks now.  It's not long enough for a complete picture of its impact on his condition, but long enough to get an idea of how it's going for him.<br /><br />His coat is very nice.  It was nice before, and I haven't seen any change in the coat condition.  The Ideal Balance diet is at least maintaining his coat in good condition.  We need more time to see the food's long term impact in Rex's coat.  4 stars for coat maintenance.<br /><br />Rex has a tendency to gain weight.  We really have to watch how much he eats.  And Ideal Balance helps him pack it on!  This means I can feed him less, which means I'm buying less food in the long run.  But I really have to watch his weight.  And it means that he is getting a lot out of the food.  The crude protein is 21.5% and crude fat is 12.5%.  The protein is not high, but the fat content is maybe a little higher than I'd seek for him.  I might choose a weight control version of Ideal Balance if this becomes his regular diet (and if one exists).  5 stars for body weight maintenance.<br /><br />Now the down and dirty part of the review...stools.  A dog's stool can tell you a lot about how he is tolerating his diet.  Rex's stools on Ideal Balance are firm, maybe a little larger than they were on his previous food, and do not smell any more objectionable than normal.  This tells me he is digesting the food normally, as well as close to optimally.  They could be a little smaller, but not so much that if I wasn't looking for a change that I'd have necessarily noticed it.  5 stars for stool quality.<br /><br />Overall, I give Hill's Science Diet Ideal Balance Dog Food 4 stars.  If there were a 2nd meat source and/or soy wasn't present, I could in good faith give it 5 stars, based on Rex's condition on the diet.  If you do try it, be sure to monitor your dog's weight, and adjust how much you feed accordingly.",Positive,received hill science diet ideal balance dog food try bzzagent im feeding terrier tends show result change diet quicker corgi belgian sheepdog ive dog mom year including participating dog sport sled dog running agility dog show proper nutrition vital dog health ability participate thing love currently dont activity dog still picky eatwhen received bzzkit lb bag hill science diet ideal balance dog food checked ingredient first listed chicken good followed brown rice whole grain wheat good meat ingredient better corn next cracked pearl barley soybean meal chicken meal admit paused soybean meal experience soy positive addition dog food find food contain result looser stool greater volume dog overall condition high one fed food without soy inexpensive ingredient associated filler dog community curious see terrier would handle fare food star one meat ingredient first ingredient inclusion soyrex terrier became immediately interested opened bag anxious see smell must enticing he picky eater anticipated hed like ideal balance didnt anticipate eager get slowly course day switched ideal balance previous food reduce stomach upset diet change found ate ideal balance nugget first cleaning bowl may new novel may liked better he doghe couldnt tell seems like much even use ideal balance training treat star tasterex eating ideal balance couple week long enough complete picture impact condition long enough get idea going himhis coat nice nice havent seen change coat condition ideal balance diet least maintaining coat good condition need time see food long term impact rex coat star coat maintenancerex tendency gain weight really watch much eats ideal balance help pack mean feed less mean im buying less food long run really watch weight mean getting lot food crude protein crude fat protein high fat content maybe little higher id seek might choose weight control version ideal balance becomes regular diet one exists star body weight maintenancenow dirty part reviewstools dog stool tell lot tolerating diet rex stool ideal balance firm maybe little larger previous food smell objectionable normal tell digesting food normally well close optimally could little smaller much wasnt looking change id necessarily noticed star stool qualityoverall give hill science diet ideal balance dog food star nd meat source andor soy wasnt present could good faith give star based rex condition diet try sure monitor dog weight adjust much feed accordingly

5,Super healthy and not sugary sweet,I love these cereal bars...the mixed nuts with protein bars are my favorite. They have the right amount of crunch and have 10gm of protein. They are definitely very heavy on 'calories from fat' but keep me full much longer than a regular cereal bar. The best part I like about these bars is that they are not extra sugary and have the right amount of sugar to just remove the blandness of the nuts. LOVE IT.,Positive,love cereal barsthe mixed nut protein bar favorite right amount crunch gm protein definitely heavy calorie fat keep full much longer regular cereal bar best part like bar extra sugary right amount sugar remove blandness nut love
4,If you are in the mood for peanuts...,"These are perfect for the peanut fan in your life - basically what you have is a ton of peanuts held together by peanut butter.  Now true they threw in a bit of granola and some fake honey like stuff to kick it up a notch - but 95% of what is in this bar is either peanuts or something made from peanuts.  Needless to say that the fat content is pretty high, but you DO get some protein in the mix.<br /><br />I don't know of many people who could eat more then one of these - maybe my youngest - but most people will need a full beverage because much like bar peanuts, these Big Nut bars are salty.  The good news is that they are filling.  So if you are stuck in a long meeting at work and your stomach rumbles while the lunch hour looks to be sneaking farther and farther away - one of these should do the trick.<br /><br />Though they probably won't be a regular buy in our household (I mean, where's the chocolate REALLY?) they are most likely something that we will pick up now and again for road trips or to keep an extra one in the desk drawer at work.<br /><br />***Adding to the review - apparently not ALL of the bars are salty - the first one I ate was.  A few days later on a road trip I had another one and it was far sweeter then the first.  Perhaps the batch my box came from wasn't fully mixed - either way they were good sweet or salty***",Positive,perfect peanut fan life basically ton peanut held together peanut butter true threw bit granola fake honey like stuff kick notch bar either peanut something made peanut needless say fat content pretty high get protein mixi dont know many people could eat one maybe youngest people need full beverage much like bar peanut big nut bar salty good news filling stuck long meeting work stomach rumble lunch hour look sneaking farther farther away one trickthough probably wont regular buy household mean wheres chocolate really likely something pick road trip keep extra one desk drawer workadding review apparently bar salty first one ate day later road trip another one far sweeter first perhaps batch box came wasnt fully mixed either way good sweet salty
5,"Great way to prevent ""dog breath""","Within days of starting a routine of one petite Greenie each day (my dog is 20 pounds), dog breath is gone.  It did not upset his GI tract, and he loves the taste.  The price is much more reasonable if you buy a Mega Treat Pak from a vendor online compared to a smaller amount in a pet store, although a trial with the individually wrapped ones is a good way to start out.  They arrive in slide-zipper lock bags, which helps to keep them fresh.

The seller sent a pre-delivery email letting me know that my plants were on the way & how to care for them when they arrived. Then, the seller sent a post-delivery email asking how the plants were doing & if I had any questions/concerns.  This seller wants the plants to thrive & does everything possible to make sure that happens.<br /><br />I agree with Lisa from Texas... This seller loves what he does. You will not be disappointed!

5,Most Natural without any artificial sweetners,"I grew up drinking coconut water of the freshly cut fruits from trees. I tasted all the brands except ""Zico"". I found ""Naked"" the closest to the fresh natural coconut water. It didn't taste any artificial contents nor sweeteners like other brands taste probably to enhance taste. Especially Vita coco does taste like natural coconut water with little bit of added sweetener flavor. This is my personal opinion.

4,"The slices are, um, greasy","This review is for the regular sliced pepperoni. The way I use them is to nuke them in the microwave for a couple minutes and it makes a nice spicy pepperoni chip for a low carb diet. Kind of reminds me of thin slices of spicy bacon. Anyway I have done this with lots of different kinds of pepperoni. This pepperoni astonishes me at the quantity of fat that is thrown off during cooking. The grease soaks through several layers of paper towel. People talked about eating them raw and if you did, that would be a lot of fat! No other pepperoni I have tried has generated this quantity of fat during cooking.<br /><br />Now once they have crisped up and you have gotten rid of most of the fat, they are crispy and quite nice. The slices are very thin, so if you go too long they will burn in a flash. I am going to try the thick sliced to see how they work.<br /><br />**UPDATE** tried the thick sliced and they are perfect for my application of pepperoni chips! Way better than the thin sliced. Still amazed by how much orange grease comes off these things during microwaving, but when they are done cooking they are a great consistency and have a nice amount of kick to them. Kind of like spicy bacon. I imagine the thick would be very good on pizza if you don't mind some oil added to your pie.",Positive,review regular sliced pepperoni way use nuke microwave couple minute make nice spicy pepperoni chip low carb diet kind reminds thin slice spicy bacon anyway done lot different kind pepperoni pepperoni astonishes quantity fat thrown cooking grease soak several layer paper towel people talked eating raw would lot fat pepperoni tried generated quantity fat cookingnow crisped gotten rid fat crispy quite nice slice thin go long burn flash going try thick sliced see workupdate tried thick sliced perfect application pepperoni chip way better thin sliced still amazed much orange grease come thing microwaving done cooking great consistency nice amount kick kind like spicy bacon imagine thick would good pizza dont mind oil added pie

1,Low. Low. I repeat: Low.,"I'm not stupid. I have nearly a degree from a major university. I read this description over and over, and still it didn't make any sense. Ten bars! Pack of two! Two boxes! Forty-eight! Hike!<br /><br />Like me, you'll probably be surprised by the dearth of product. You get two boxes. Each contains five packets. Each packet has 2 bars, sure -- but the weight of each packet is 1.5 oz, which is less than two-thirds the weight of ONE regular Clif bar. These bars are maybe 1 1/2"" wide, 4"" long, and 1/4"" thick. You'll be tempted to use them to file your nails. Why would Clif suddenly decide that humans can't take a granola bar that weighs more than .75 oz -- and package two of them together? Gosh, let's all think.<br /><br />Anyway, now you know. On the plus side, if you don't like these -- I'd give them a 5 out of 10 on taste -- just hold the box in your open palm, and a hefty breeze will take them away.",Negative,im stupid nearly degree major university read description still didnt make sense ten bar pack two two box fortyeight hikelike youll probably surprised dearth product get two box contains five packet packet bar sure weight packet oz less twothirds weight one regular clif bar bar maybe wide long thick youll tempted use file nail would clif suddenly decide human cant take granola bar weighs oz package two together gosh let thinkanyway know plus side dont like id give taste hold box open palm hefty breeze take away

5,Oreo flavored crackers without the creme filling,"These are great snacks for traveling, such as, by airplane or car.  The cookie comes in the shape of a small cracker.  The cracker is less messy than a cookie which can break apart and crumble; and for this reason a preferred treat.<br /><br />The texture is comparable to a medium crunchy chip and very light to eat.

2,STINKY!,"This is a really fun idea! It is a fun treat to give them, and my dogs REALLY like it. The reason why I am giving it a low rating, is because it stinks, really bad! The smell is so offensive that my boyfriend won't let me feed this treat to my dogs while he's around. If my dogs didn't love the taste, and if it wasn't so much fun to feed to them, it would be in the garbage. I won't be buying it again, and don't recommend it. However, if you ever find it on sale or find a free sample or something, it is kind of a fun thing to try ONCE. Another issue is the fact that it comes in dark flavors, which can (and did) stain their mouths and cause dark tear stains.",Negative,really fun idea fun treat give dog really like reason giving low rating stink really bad smell offensive boyfriend wont let feed treat dog he around dog didnt love taste wasnt much fun feed would garbage wont buying dont recommend however ever find sale find free sample something kind fun thing try another issue fact come dark flavor stain mouth cause dark tear stain

5,Love this product,"Our 10 year old lab mix started having problemswith his hip joints. He has always been an active dog and watching him lay around and not want to interact was hard to see. Initially our vet gave us Rimadyl to get him through the acute phase, but it is a bit pricey and I know that it is hard on their stomach and kidneys. I searched the internet and read reviews for several days, each time my reasearch led me back to this product. Off I went to the local pet supply store to get this treat. When I opened the bag I thought for sure that my dog would turn his nose up at them, they smell awful....well my husband now calls these ""doggie crack"", our dog LOVES these treats.

5,LOVE RED HOT BLUES!!!,"OK, so before we opted to purchase these from Amazon, my whole family was a fan of these chips and if you never tried them you have too. They are absolutely delicious, spiced up just right, perfect in taco salad, with salsa or just fine all alone (and it helps if your alone too because when sharing these chips are addictive!)<br />But I HAVE TO SAY that these chips purchased through amazon were the best NO EXAGGERATION, that I have had.

4,Lindt 85% from Amazon came in the original formula,"I ordered a 12-pack of the Lindt 85% cacao chocolate bars from Amazon in January... They are my favorite variety.... the 90% is too bitter for me, while the 70% has too much sugar. But the 85% is just right...and perfect for slowly melting in your mouth... And supposedly good for you health too, if taken in moderation.<br /><br />But despite some of the comments above, the box I received had the same (good) formulation for the 85% bars that I've seen in the past -- 5g of protein and 5g of sugar per serving size (four squares), along with 15g of carbohydrates (5%).<br /><br />I find I'm really satisfied by eating just two squares after lunch... And taking each square, and snapping it into four smaller pieces, thus eight small pieces in total... Letting each piece slowly melt in my mouth tastes great and is very satisfying as well.",Positive,ordered pack lindt cacao chocolate bar amazon january favorite variety bitter much sugar rightand perfect slowly melting mouth supposedly good health taken moderationbut despite comment box received good formulation bar ive seen past g protein g sugar per serving size four square along g carbohydrate find im really satisfied eating two square lunch taking square snapping four smaller piece thus eight small piece total letting piece slowly melt mouth taste great satisfying well
5,My most craved candy! So creamy and delicious!!,"If you like white chocolate, or even if you ""don't"", you will most likely LOVE these! I love that the outer shell/creamy white chocolate inside/small cocoa pieces all have a different texture. If the truffles are somewhat cold the shell has even more of a ""crunch"".

5,Everything you could want!,"I bought these for my wife who loves anything strawberry. First of all they must lie about the calories because they are very tasty andd sweet. They are not crunchy, by rather they are light and airy. The packages are small, but a great snack and there were twelve of them. That brings me to my recommendation for you to order two boxes, because I just put in an order for a box for my wife.

1,No more like lemon zest than wood shavings,"This product is NOT lemon zest.  Bears no resemblance to lemon zest - does not look like lemon zest, does not smell like lemon zest, nor does it taste like lemon zest.  In fact the label says 'Contains granules of dehydrated lemon peel'.  The picture of lush, juicy lemons is hugely misleading and if I was able to give this product no stars, I would.  I thought I would give it a try, but the consistency of the rehydrated whatever it is was mushy, tasteless and without smell.  I did not risk putting it in my ginger cookies and had to make a quick trip to the store to get some real lemons.  Don't waste your money as I did.",Negative,product lemon zest bear resemblance lemon zest look like lemon zest smell like lemon zest taste like lemon zest fact label say contains granule dehydrated lemon peel picture lush juicy lemon hugely misleading able give product star would thought would give try consistency rehydrated whatever mushy tasteless without smell risk putting ginger cooky make quick trip store get real lemon dont waste money

5,Best tasting high protein bar,"I believe I've tried just about every bar in existence. I found this bar at my local REI and while expensive I figured I'd give it a try. from the first bite to the last this was the best tasting high protein bar I have ever had. Please note that I said best of high protein bars, I've had plenty of other fantastic bars, especially whole/organic food bars.. i.e. Probar, Think, Potent, etc... This bar is not a delivry of carb's, sugar, fat etc.. it's focus is protein and it does a very good job at it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this bar if you object to the poor sawdust taste of most protein bars (Cliff Builder, Myoplex, Think, Powerbar, etc...) I also find that most protein bars start off OK, then then when the tastebuds start to find the underlying protein and lack of sweetness it becomes teidious to finish... not the Stinger! I actually feel it gets better with taste and the coconut flavors are very subtle and build toward the finish of the bar.<br /><br />Melt factor is better then expected, far superior to Myoplex.<br /><br />It pack almost 400 calories via 20g of protein.",Positive,believe ive tried every bar existence found bar local rei expensive figured id give try first bite last best tasting high protein bar ever please note said best high protein bar ive plenty fantastic bar especially wholeorganic food bar ie probar think potent etc bar delivry carbs sugar fat etc focus protein good job iti highly recommend bar object poor sawdust taste protein bar cliff builder myoplex think powerbar etc also find protein bar start ok tastebud start find underlying protein lack sweetness becomes teidious finish stinger actually feel get better taste coconut flavor subtle build toward finish barmelt factor better expected far superior myoplexit pack almost calorie via g protein
2,tastes like medium roast with slight burnt/bitter aftertaste,"I am not taking to the taste of this coffee. For me, it had a medium roast flavor, (meaning not too strong), and a slight burnt-bitter aftertaste. There is an ever-so slight hint of cocoa in the flavor, not to it's detriment. I did not want a super-strong coffee, and I was  hoping that this would not harbor the burnt/bitter aftertaste that some of the stronger coffees seem to have. In any case, I am trying to find a medium roast, good smooth coffee to replace the Van Houtte Kenyan k-cups, since they are not being sold now, and Tree Hugger is not the one to fill those shoes for my taste.",Negative,taking taste coffee medium roast flavor meaning strong slight burntbitter aftertaste everso slight hint cocoa flavor detriment want superstrong coffee hoping would harbor burntbitter aftertaste stronger coffee seem case trying find medium roast good smooth coffee replace van houtte kenyan kcups since sold tree hugger one fill shoe taste

5,Sweet Paprika - Good with Everything!!!,"First of all, there are two kinds of paprika - sweet and hot.  Both are delicious but the Szeged sweet paprika is more versatile than the hot kind (which is also awesome!). I have been using this spice for years and the Hungarian type is consistently better than any other type/brand.  Use this on meat, veggies, cassaroles, salad, baked bries, quiches, egg dishes, shrimp, pretty much anything.  I use this in soup all winter long, especially with gulyas levas (this is a traditional Hungarian soup though it is often confused with goulash) and czipetke.<br /><br />This product is the large restaurant size, which is the only size to have if you do any amount of cooking because once you try this you will love it's versatility!!!!",Positive,first two kind paprika sweet hot delicious szeged sweet paprika versatile hot kind also awesome using spice year hungarian type consistently better typebrand use meat veggie cassaroles salad baked brie quiche egg dish shrimp pretty much anything use soup winter long especially gulyas levas traditional hungarian soup though often confused goulash czipetkethis product large restaurant size size amount cooking try love versatility
5,One of the healthier chips,"Simple, uncomplicated and healthy ingredients. Cooked in expeller pressed oils (not heated to extract, which causes loss of nutritional value), Kettle chips have a firmer texture than most others, but they have great flavor, even though no flavor enhancers are used except for the spices. No preservatives is also a plus. My only negative experience with them is an occasional bag in which the chips in the very bottom of the bag are oily. I was so pleased to find them at a price nearly a third less than what I have been paying in the grocery market.",Positive,simple uncomplicated healthy ingredient cooked expeller pressed oil heated extract cause loss nutritional value kettle chip firmer texture others great flavor even though flavor enhancer used except spice preservative also plus negative experience occasional bag chip bottom bag oily pleased find price nearly third less paying grocery market

I have bought both the Vanilla Bean and the Chocolate Fudge. I can't decide which one I like more...they are both so delicious! It is amazing how much healthy nutrition they cram into such a small container. I still can't believe there are organic fruits and vegetables in this drink. Each container is only 255 calories, too.

5,"Quality, Value and Presentation.","Yep, that's right, 5 stars!  This contents of this little box packs a nutritional punch with 24 grams of protein and 12 grams of fiber, you know you're being good to yourself! That's 3 stars, add a star for flavor and another for convenience and value and there you have 5 stars!  Anyway,  whoever suggested that one combine the edamame and the fruit nut mix is definitely on to something because the edamame is pretty dry and bland so, the mix flavors it up a bit and make it much for palatable.  The hummus is pretty good and I really appreciated the lightness and flavor of the crackers.  The dark chocolate also has good flavor and is a prefect way to top off this meal.  This is perfect for me to tuck in my purse and bring it for lunch when I'm working or on outings with my family (although I think my 5 year old will prefer the peanut butter one:)).

5,Excellent for what it is,"In my mind, to qualify as a ""cookie,"" a food needs to possess two ingredients: sugar and fat. If you reduce or eliminate either or both of those, you no longer have a ""cookie,"" but a sad imitation of one, generally not worth eating. Quaker has tried to make a better-for-you cookie not by reducing its evil components, but by adding other virtuous ones, in this case whole grain oats. This yields a cookie with whole grain and fiber to offset, at least partially, its less nutritious aspects.<br /><br />Let's look at the numbers of two very classic cookies. Three Nabisco Oreos weigh 34 grams, have 160 calories, 7 grams of fat and 1 gram of fiber. Three Chips Ahoy Chocolate Chip cookies weigh 33 grams, have 160 calories, 8 grams of fat and 1 gram of fiber.<br /><br />One of these Quakers weighs 42 grams, has 180 calories, 8 grams of fat and 4 grams of fiber. So you get about 25% more cookie for about the same calories and fat, and you get 4 times the fiber. If they were as good as the other two, you'd have a hands down winner. Unfortunately, this is where reality intrudes. They aren't.<br /><br />On the other hand, they're not bad at all, perhaps just a step behind the Nabiscos and Keeblers that we all love. If you're like me and have reached that stage of life where you need to be sure to get enough fiber every day, they represent a painless way to get about a sixth of what's needed. And you will feel like you've eaten a cookie and not a styrofoam imposter.",Positive,mind qualify cookie food need possess two ingredient sugar fat reduce eliminate either longer cookie sad imitation one generally worth eating quaker tried make betterforyou cookie reducing evil component adding virtuous one case whole grain oat yield cookie whole grain fiber offset least partially less nutritious aspectslets look number two classic cooky three nabisco oreo weigh gram calorie gram fat gram fiber three chip ahoy chocolate chip cooky weigh gram calorie gram fat gram fiberone quaker weighs gram calorie gram fat gram fiber get cookie calorie fat get time fiber good two youd hand winner unfortunately reality intrudes arenton hand theyre bad perhaps step behind nabiscos keeblers love youre like reached stage life need sure get enough fiber every day represent painless way get sixth whats needed feel like youve eaten cookie styrofoam imposter
2,poorly assembled,"While I have no complaint about the contents of this order, half of the purpose for paying so much for some tea and trinkets is the arrangement. This item arrived looking like it was simply tossed together as an afterthought. The appeal of sending a gift basket is that it is supposed to look pretty (like the image). If the vendor can't take the time to properly arrange a gift basket, especially if I paid extra for wrapping on top of the cost of the basket itself, I would be hesitant to order such an item from amazon in the future.

It's adequately hot, although not the kind of hot that burns your taste buds for a long time. It's made in Guadalajara, Mexico which adds a little mystery to it.

4,More depth and flavor than I was expecting; recommended,"If you ever come to Austin some of the best 'Tex-Mex' food is from a local chain called Chuy's. You have to ask for  creamy jalapeno sauce that goes wonderfully with their chips. I was hoping this sauce would be as good as the Chuy's one. It is better. The sauce has surprising depth; it is fresh tasting, and well balanced. Not too spicy at all, but the spice mixture definitely comes though, garlic, onion, bell peppers. It is very easy for packaged sauces to lose their spices with the preseratives and packing. The jalpeno sauce does not. It has a lot of uses for me. You can use it as a full flavored salad dressing. As a diping sauce. You can add it to other sauces. You can dress Mexican food items, etc. It is also a decent price on Amazon for a 6 pack especially with subscribe and save.

My lab is an aggressive chewer and considering this is edible it makes him that much more excited as he LOVES food. He enjoys these bones but devours them in less than 20 minutes. I usually give it to him for a few minutes until he eats half of it and then I take it away to save for next time. This obviously would get very expensive so he has his non-edible Nylabones most of the time and these are special treats.,Positive,dont like controversy surrounding rawhide bone dont want take risk lab getting blockage exclusively give booda bone safe lab aggressive chewer considering edible make much excited love food enjoys bone devours less minute usually give minute eats half take away save next time obviously would get expensive nonedible nylabones time special treat
5,"Great taste, fun to chew, strong scientific backing for health claims of Xylitol","After using an ""all-natural"" gum (that contained cane sugar) and getting my first cavity in 12 years after 6 months of use, I knew I needed a switch. I heard about Xylitol from a naturopathic student, that basically, the bad bacteria in your mouth feed on Xylitol but they can't digest it, and the good bacteria can eat it, so they proliferate. I thought I had tried other Xylitol gums in the past and didn't like them, but I decided to give this another chance because I want a gum to chew after meals that is actually good for my teeth. I was pleasantly surprised at the Spry gum! It has a great flavor (which goes away pretty soon after chewing, but it's a nice shot of good taste), but the best part is that the gum itself has a great texture to it and continues to be fun to chew for as long as you want. It doesn't even turn hard after drinking water like most gums do. I am a medical student so I did a search of the research literature and the claims of Xylitol are more than proven. However, all of the literature and research studies explain that you need 4-12 g of Xylitol a day (no need to get more than 15), but the average piece of gum has .75-1 g, so you'll need to chew at least 4-5 pieces a day to get the dental benefits (chewing it only sporadically, i.e. once a day, did NOT show any dental benefits). No problem for me, I chew one after every meal (I have 5-6 a day), and love having the fresh clean feeling as well as knowing that I'm doing something great for my teeth.",Positive,using allnatural gum contained cane sugar getting first cavity year month use knew needed switch heard xylitol naturopathic student basically bad bacteria mouth feed xylitol cant digest good bacteria eat proliferate thought tried xylitol gum past didnt like decided give another chance want gum chew meal actually good teeth pleasantly surprised spry gum great flavor go away pretty soon chewing nice shot good taste best part gum great texture continues fun chew long want doesnt even turn hard drinking water like gum medical student search research literature claim xylitol proven however literature research study explain need g xylitol day need get average piece gum g youll need chew least piece day get dental benefit chewing sporadically ie day show dental benefit problem chew one every meal day love fresh clean feeling well knowing im something great teeth

I've never felt like I had so failed my baby.  After that, I taste tested Earth's Best, Enfamil and my own breast milk (too much information?).  The latter two were tasty, and quite similar to each other (with a sweetness to them).  When it came to Earth's Best, I had to agree with my baby--it tasted bad, with almost a metallic flavor to it.

5,Love this candy Bar. High in K+ too.,The nuts and raisens make this a high Potassium candy bar actually good for you. Really no kidding. I discovered this in 94 when I was diagnosed with low K+...to the extremes. I was in this super crave anything with K+ from Bananas which everyone knows and avacodo's to these little morsels. At the time they had come out in a trick or treat snack size or about 1/4 the size of this candy bar today. I was scarfing them. I hadn't been diagnosed yet. Once that happened my own instincts and natural cravings made more sense...I was looking at the ingredients to this candy bar at the time because I'd had sucn intense cravings for the Chunky and back then they actually listed the K+ levels....per full size bar at over 300 mg. That certainly explained it. Since I've never denied my cravings for it though my K levels are back to normal. Today they no longer list K levels.....but why not Chunky? You should reconsider....nothing wrong with promotion of some good stuff along with this product. K+ is good for people after excercise and hard work. Of course it's the raisens and peanuts that are the big contributors. This isn't over the top but who wouldn't rather take a nibble of a yummy candy bar that's good for you instead of a vitamen pill that's questionable and lacks the raisens and nuts. I wish they would bring back the orginal flavors they had in the early 70's too. I think one was cashew.....oh yeah! Good stuff. Amazon's distributors come to our rescue as no longer carried up here in super small town USA...thanks everyone for that. Watch the prices go up and down on all of these bars through out the year. I've bought the BIG sized bars too as it all depends on the price per ounce. I buy before the heat of the summer and have not had any problems with melted bars so far. All have been fresh too.

5,Ah... my new best friend!,"I am changing my diet to one that is low carb, unfortunately I love sweets.  The little yellow packets of sweetner have added bulking agents that up my carb count, and I use way too many of them in my drinks to stay within my carb limit.  Enter EZ-Sweetz: it's so convenient, will last forever, and works in all types of recipes- baked goods, drinks, frozen desserts....<br />I will definitely order this again, and will probably order the travel bottles for use in restaurants.

I have had the other version (spice chai) and love that this tea is also made in the double spice version.  I've had chai tea many places, and I've yet to find one with the beautiful flavor this one has.

3,Seemed like a great idea...but...,"This sounded like a great idea, especially for people who like expensive vitamin water that comes pre-bottled. This is a greener way to get the same flavor and vitamin benefit with a reusable bottle. This would be great, except I didn't like it all that much. It was just okay.<br /><br />It was hard to measure ""a squeeze"". The bottle has markings, but since it's gray, you can't see how much you've used. Plus, every time you squeeze, it's a little different. The first cup I tried, I squeezed some in without measuring. It seemed a little weak. Then, I measured 8 oz. water and 1 tablespoon (the .5 oz serving listed on the bottle) of the Energy drink. This produced a stronger tasting and much sweeter tasting outcome. But, that was a little strong on the vitamin taste.<br /><br />The fruit punch flavor isn't horrible, but the sugar substitute and the vitamins leave an after taste. It reminds me a little of chewable children's aspirin or cold tablets. Not really what I was hoping for.<br /><br />I know there are some people who will like this because they like other vitamin waters. It really isn't all that different from the bottled vitamin water. I just don't happen to like that all that much either.",Neutral,sounded like great idea especially people like expensive vitamin water come prebottled greener way get flavor vitamin benefit reusable bottle would great except didnt like much okayit hard measure squeeze bottle marking since gray cant see much youve used plus every time squeeze little different first cup tried squeezed without measuring seemed little weak measured oz water tablespoon oz serving listed bottle energy drink produced stronger tasting much sweeter tasting outcome little strong vitamin tastethe fruit punch flavor isnt horrible sugar substitute vitamin leave taste reminds little chewable childrens aspirin cold tablet really hoping fori know people like like vitamin water really isnt different bottled vitamin water dont happen like much either

3,"A nice box, but a little pricey!","I purchased this as a gift for someone.  The box is a nice sized box, however, the box itself does not look like the one in the advertised photo. The paint, which is supposedly hand painted, is not as deep in color and detail as in the photo and the roses are not as defined as in the photo.  I expected this gourmet ""food"" gift basket to be that!  There is no food, and since it is a gift basket, I expected the items to be displayed coming out of the box as in the photo to make it attractive looking.  The items inside are packed inside with the box lid closed.  I found this gift was nice, but was a little disappointed in it.

2,Massively dented cans,"The product inside the can is very good. I use it for cooking.<br />The packaging is inadequate. Half of the cans arrived severely dented. I opened the most mis-shapen can and saw no breach in the seal of the container; so I still used it despite misgivings.<br /> I saw that Amazon does not accept return of this canned product.

4,Good variety,"This gift basket had a good variety of sweets (truffles, cookies, nuts and fruit mixture, napolitans, chocolate covered raisins, caramels) as well as some savory (cheese spread, crackers, peanuts, almonds), plus a few things that got eaten before I had a chance to note them for this review.  Other than the Sunmaid chocolate covered raisins I was not familiar with the brand names. For example, the most of the sweets were made by Kenzi, of whom I had never heard. Their quality was O.K., but not outstanding (but then again I am very picky  - my son thought it was just fine, but he was probably full from eating the pilfered items). The quantities of each product were the small sizes common to gift baskets. All in all, this is not a basket that will wow a chocolate connoisseur and, again typical of gift baskets, is not a great deal, but it would definately make an appreciated hostess or other gift.",Positive,gift basket good variety sweet truffle cooky nut fruit mixture napolitans chocolate covered raisin caramel well savory cheese spread cracker peanut almond plus thing got eaten chance note review sunmaid chocolate covered raisin familiar brand name example sweet made kenzi never heard quality ok outstanding picky son thought fine probably full eating pilfered item quantity product small size common gift basket basket wow chocolate connoisseur typical gift basket great deal would definately make appreciated hostess gift

5,Lingham's Original Hot Sauce,"Lingham's Hot Sauce ""Original"" is my absolute favorite everyday hot sauce, it is a perfect combination of sweet followed with spicy addition to Chinese food, eggs, or anything that needs a kick in the flavor department. I was introduced to this product as a young boy when my family would take me into LA's China Town for Dim Sum and we would go to the Asian Market for supplies for the the meals Mom would fix at home. I was able to buy it at CostPlus World Market for a period of time but they stopped carrying it.

5,Good quality lavender,"Very pleased with this. Good lavender flavor, good scent. The taste is strong, clean, and sharp.<br /><br />The website of the manufacturer appears to reflect a company preoccupied with product quality and health.<br /><br />This doesn't appear to be the most economical lavender flavor available, but when you factor in the size of the bottle--4 oz., twice the size of most--it has a very competitive price.<br /><br />I find this roughly on par with the Herb Pharm lavender <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001TL6FS"">Lavender Extract 1 Ounces</a>, but only 1/4 the price,<br />and greatly superior to the chemical-tasting Star Kay White <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003L1XMAA"">Pure Lavender Extract 2 oz.</a>",Positive,pleased good lavender flavor good scent taste strong clean sharpthe website manufacturer appears reflect company preoccupied product quality healththis doesnt appear economical lavender flavor available factor size bottle oz twice size mostit competitive pricei find roughly par herb pharm lavender lavender extract ounce priceand greatly superior chemicaltasting star kay white pure lavender extract oz
5,Good for Low Cal Snack,"I am always dieting and ordered the multi flavor package of these.  I admit I like some flavors more than others.

A filling, crunchy snack bagb you can keep in a desk or in the car that won't wreck a diet but is emotionally satisfying if you need a saltry crunch.  I didn't think I would like the vinegar ones, but I really do.  The sligtly salty ones are the least flavorful in my opinion but sometimes I use dip with them. I will definitely order again.  The bagsv are big and sometimes I only need to eat half to feel satisfied, honestly. (Not like the PopC**ps where I can eat a whole ig bag) Wish I could get them in stores.

5,Thicker consistency is much appreciated,"The first prunes are good, but much too runny past 6 months.

He's fun to watch, learning new things.<br /><br />I do worry about the added sugar, so I've been holding back a little on these lately, offering them less often and giving him Cheerios instead. The Gerber/Nestle corn crunchies are a little up in the sodium, too.

5,best healthy rice beverage,"This is the richest most milk-like rice beverage and the label on it does not mention canola oil, which contains up to 2% toxic erucic acid and is found in many rice beverages that are fed to children! Canola oil cannot be used by US FDA regulation in infant food.

5,A++++++++++++,"If you're a chocoholic like me, then this is food from heaven.  My local grocery store used to sell something very similar in bulk.  The day they stopped selling it I spiraled into a deep depression.  Then I found Love Crunch sold in the big bags at Costco.  All was good until Costco stopped carrying it.  That's when I had my second bout of depression.  Now I get my fix through Amazon.  When it comes to food, it's all a matter of individual taste and my taste buds love this product.  I can see why some people would not be a fan of this because the chocolate can be overwhelming.  That's fine by me because it just means there is more in stock for me to buy!  :)<br />The only negative thing I have to say is that they skimp on the berries, but I don't really care because I'm not buying it for the berries.  :)",Positive,youre chocoholic like food heaven local grocery store used sell something similar bulk day stopped selling spiraled deep depression found love crunch sold big bag costco good costco stopped carrying thats second bout depression get fix amazon come food matter individual taste taste bud love product see people would fan chocolate overwhelming thats fine mean stock buy negative thing say skimp berry dont really care im buying berry

4,Tasty and Satisfying,"I received my pack of Kind Healthy Grains Clusters in a firm, cardboard ""envelope"" that protected it enough that it was not pulverized as some reviewers had experienced.  The cereal had varying sized clusters of fruit and grains as well as some loose, individual ones, similar to other granolas.  I tried it as a snack one evening when I had the munchies and found it tasty and satisfying.  It was crunchy and not too sweet and I enjoyed the wholesome taste.  I didn't notice a lot of vanilla flavor and the blueberries were not as flavorful or large as the ones in ""Blueberry Morning"" cereal, but they were identifiable as blueberries.  I have not tried it with milk or in yogurt yet but feel that it would be very good if eaten that way.  I would purchase it again.",Positive,received pack kind healthy grain cluster firm cardboard envelope protected enough pulverized reviewer experienced cereal varying sized cluster fruit grain well loose individual one similar granola tried snack one evening munchies found tasty satisfying crunchy sweet enjoyed wholesome taste didnt notice lot vanilla flavor blueberry flavorful large one blueberry morning cereal identifiable blueberry tried milk yogurt yet feel would good eaten way would purchase
5,A Visit to the Peppermint Room,"Several years ago, I went on a tour of the Celestial Seasonings tea factory in Boulder, Colorado.  The guide showed us the bales of tea as they arrived, machines that ground and mixed the tea, and a machine that put the tea in tea bags.  The tour included a visit to the room where the peppermint tea was stored.  Our guide told us that peppermint was stored separately so that it would not contaminate the other teas.  He did not tell us what was to come.<br /><br />The doorway into the peppermint room was surrounded by bright red stripes. This should have served as a warning to us.  We all innocently strolled into the peppermint room.  The smell of peppermint was overpowering.  It entered my nose, my head, my lungs, and then my whole being was infused with peppermint.  What a rush!  The crowd stampeded out of the room in a hurry.  For the rest of the day and into the next, all I could smell and taste was the mint.<br /><br />I am now addicted to <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000E63L8S"">Celestial Seasonings Peppermint Tea</a>.  Every time I have some, I am reminded of that fateful day in Boulder.  The events of that day have changed my life forever.  Amazingly, the tea is still legal, openly sold in stores and on the Internet.  I think that the tea is great, but then again I am not an unbiased observer.  On your next visit to Boulder, take the tour.

2,Yuck,"I decided to be risky and order a big box on unknown tea - this stuff, along with big boxes of Blueberry and Raspberry.  The other teas were better than expected - but this stuff was just plain unflavorful and weird tasting.  Couldn't taste the strawberry.  Perhaps the weird taste is the Rooibos in the tea.  I have to be sure to never buy a rooibos based tea again, although the stuff is supposed to be good for you.<br /><br />I drink my tea iced and always brew a bag of plain ol green tea in with the herb bags, but I don't think the green tea messed this tea up.  When I first opened the foil pouch, the tea looked different and didn't have that rich fruity smell of the other teas and I thought 'uh oh'.  I was right.<br /><br />Won't be buying this again, but that is purely my personal taste - the kids didn't like it either and they are big tea drinkers.",Negative,decided risky order big box unknown tea stuff along big box blueberry raspberry tea better expected stuff plain unflavorful weird tasting couldnt taste strawberry perhaps weird taste rooibos tea sure never buy rooibos based tea although stuff supposed good youi drink tea iced always brew bag plain ol green tea herb bag dont think green tea messed tea first opened foil pouch tea looked different didnt rich fruity smell tea thought uh oh rightwont buying purely personal taste kid didnt like either big tea drinker

5,Best sardines I've found,"Season sardines are the best I've ever tasted. I particularly like the whole sardines in olive oil, but other varieties I've tried are also good.

They're also relatively inexpensive.",Positive,season sardine best ive ever tasted particularly like whole sardine olive oil variety ive tried also good mellow taste mellow eliminate sardine flavor theyre salted right theyre also relatively inexpensive
3,It's ok,"This product does not disolve easy with just stiring, I threw mine into the blender to get it mixed well. I would highly recommend anybody interested in this product should go to their local healthfood store and buy the individual packets first. These packets are single servings of the product and sell for a dollar something, this is a good way to try the product out to see if it suits your family without wasting a ton of money. This is what my husband and I did, we bought two of the chocolate flavor and one of the berry flavor and have tried both out on my preschooler. She didn't seem found of either of them, the choclate has a very light chocolate flavor and it had an overpowering after taste of the greens. The berry was just way to sweet I've read people compare it to koolaid and that would be about right if you like your koolaid with 2 extra cups of sugar in it. I have used the second chocolate packet in a breakfast smoothie for her with bananas and peanut butter and that seemed to get ride of the after taste and she seemed to enjoy it.If you don't mind being creative and doing a little extra work to mask the flavor of the greens this product could be a healthy addtition to your childs diet.",Neutral,product disolve easy stiring threw mine blender get mixed well would highly recommend anybody interested product go local healthfood store buy individual packet first packet single serving product sell dollar something good way try product see suit family without wasting ton money husband bought two chocolate flavor one berry flavor tried preschooler didnt seem found either choclate light chocolate flavor overpowering taste green berry way sweet ive read people compare koolaid would right like koolaid extra cup sugar used second chocolate packet breakfast smoothie banana peanut butter seemed get ride taste seemed enjoy itif dont mind creative little extra work mask flavor green product could healthy addtition child diet

I buy mine from Market of Choice in Ashland Oregon and absolutely love it!!! It gets me moving in a much smoother way than caffeine/high fructose corn syrup based drinks.

5,Really Good Chai Latte,"If you like Chai Latte tea and don't want to fuss with making it the 'old Fashion"" way, this is a good alternative.  Of course, you have to own a K-Cup coffee machine.  I've bought a few of these boxes of 24 k-cups.  The last time I ordered them they came in a package of 2 boxes (48 total) for about $32.  Now it looks like amazon is selling them as 1 box (24 k-cups) for about $18.  To me the key to buying this (or almost any item) on amazon is to do a search first.  There are many different sellers here and they all seem to have different prices and a different number of k-cups in their boxes.  Some add shipping and some have free shipping.<br /><br />As far as the tea goes, I really like it and would highly recommend it!",Positive,like chai latte tea dont want fuss making old fashion way good alternative course kcup coffee machine ive bought box kcups last time ordered came package box total look like amazon selling box kcups key buying almost item amazon search first many different seller seem different price different number kcups box add shipping free shippingas far tea go really like would highly recommend

5,Nongluten granola,"I do not eat gluten, so it was important to me that this product be non-gluten.  I looked the package over and nowhere did I see ""without gluten"" on it, except in the ingredients where it lists the whole grains used to make this product, it did say ""gluten free oats"" but still I wondered about the other grains.  Another ingredient was amaranth, which has no gluten (neither do oats, but they easily become contaminated by gluten in processing) so I checked this site and lo and behold, it says that it is non gluten!  So, not on the package (unless I am missing it?) but yes, on this site.<br /><br />I took this bag of granola with me to my daughter/husband's house and they tried it too.  It was a very nice tasting cereal, loaded with whole grains.  I did not experience what some other reviewers said, with having no clusters in their bag (in other words, some got kind of a granola dust, but mine were big chunks, just like they are supposed to be).  Mine was packed in a box with some of those air pocket things, so it came through just fine.  I also didn't notice any funny aftertaste.  The cost is $16.56 for 3, 11 oz bags, or $14.08 through ""subscribe and save"" ($4.69 per bag).  I think this is a little higher than our local Walmart Bear Naked granola, but not that much higher.  Also, Bear Naked granola isn't gluten free (the oats are not gluten free, to my knowledge), whereas the Kind variety is.<br /><br />Although the variety of this cereal that I had (Cinnamon and Oat Clusters with Flax Seeds) did not have glycerin as an ingredient, I noticed that my bag of Bear Naked fruit and nut granola did have glycerin, apparently with the raisins and cranberries that were in it.  I have to admit, I had always associated glycerin with soap (like Neutrogena) but note too that nitroglycerin (an explosive) has glycerin.  Glycerin is also, apparently, a sweetener (probably why they use it with raisins and cranberries).<br /><br />In the end, I would say that if you like the taste of this granola, the price on this one isn't bad.  And taste is a matter of, um, taste.  Because it is non-gluten, I may just buy this instead of the Bear Naked granola that I usually buy (yes, I know that Walmart's Bear Naked granola isn't non-gluten, but I like it and it is cheap and for reasons that I do not understand, I do not have to absolutely abstain from gluten, although I usually do).  I would definitely give this granola a chance and if you like the flavor, go for it!",Positive,eat gluten important product nongluten looked package nowhere see without gluten except ingredient list whole grain used make product say gluten free oat still wondered grain another ingredient amaranth gluten neither oat easily become contaminated gluten processing checked site lo behold say non gluten package unless missing yes sitei took bag granola daughterhusbands house tried nice tasting cereal loaded whole grain experience reviewer said cluster bag word got kind granola dust mine big chunk like supposed mine packed box air pocket thing came fine also didnt notice funny aftertaste cost oz bag subscribe save per bag think little higher local walmart bear naked granola much higher also bear naked granola isnt gluten free oat gluten free knowledge whereas kind variety isalthough variety cereal cinnamon oat cluster flax seed glycerin ingredient noticed bag bear naked fruit nut granola glycerin apparently raisin cranberry admit always associated glycerin soap like neutrogena note nitroglycerin explosive glycerin glycerin also apparently sweetener probably use raisin cranberriesin end would say like taste granola price one isnt bad taste matter um taste nongluten may buy instead bear naked granola usually buy yes know walmarts bear naked granola isnt nongluten like cheap reason understand absolutely abstain gluten although usually would definitely give granola chance like flavor go

5,Best tasting/effective,"After reading reviews from baby sites, I was ready to get my red raspberry leaf tea on and strengthen my uterus and I was so excited that I got the first one I saw, which was the Alvita brand. I love the flavor, just LOVE the flavor, but I read more reviews and a lot of women gave the Traditional Medicinals better reviews so I after I ran out of the Alvita I purchased the TM. I have to say, the Alvita has a stronger tea taste and I actually got contractions when I drank it. I'm only 37.7 weeks along, but I have to say that I think this tea will help move my labor along quite well. I'll update this review later with how it went.<br /><br />UPDATE 3/28/2012:<br />I totally forgot to add my update! Well, as I'd previously believed, this tea helped me tremendously through my labor. I had my beautiful baby boy on December 12th. I had a 17 hour labor because my bag of waters prematurely ruptured and I wasn't dilating the way I was supposed to. I had to be put on pitocin (without meds for the first 14 hours) then I got the meds and then got the epidural about 45 minutes before I actually gave birth. Let me tell you, I only pushed for about 20 minutes and I was done. I attribute that 100% to the tea. I had friends who didn't drink the tea and were in labor for very short periods but pushed way longer. Also, my uterus went down very quickly and I stopped bleeding quickly as well, I forgot how soon but the doctors and nurses were amazed. I'd definitely drink it again next time around.",Positive,reading review baby site ready get red raspberry leaf tea strengthen uterus excited got first one saw alvita brand love flavor love flavor read review lot woman gave traditional medicinals better review ran alvita purchased tm say alvita stronger tea taste actually got contraction drank im week along say think tea help move labor along quite well ill update review later wentupdate totally forgot add update well id previously believed tea helped tremendously labor beautiful baby boy december th hour labor bag water prematurely ruptured wasnt dilating way supposed put pitocin without med first hour got med got epidural minute actually gave birth let tell pushed minute done attribute tea friend didnt drink tea labor short period pushed way longer also uterus went quickly stopped bleeding quickly well forgot soon doctor nurse amazed id definitely drink next time around

A former co-worker brought a huge jug of these to work and urged me to give one a try. Like the stubborn child who refuses to eat her veggies, I popped one in my mouth, with a large glass of water in hand to wash down what I expected to be the awful (to me) flavor. I was shocked to find I not only didn't object to these, but became hooked on them in short order.<br /><br />I have been unable to find this flavor in the mega jug my co-worked purchased at a big box retailer over a year ago and was pleased to find this option on Amazon for a price lower than my local grogery store. I wish that big jug were available, but these smaller cans probably assure a fresher product.<br /><br />I will add, that I am a big fan of vinegar, but am not a big fan of salt and vinegar chips.

2,Way too weak for my tastes,"What can i say, I love iced tea. I drink a lot of it, and love the convenience of these new individual serving size packets. I am also a big fan of Stash products, or rather of all the other stash products I have tried.<br />I purchased a case of all 4 varieties,  (when i say i drink iced tea, i am not kidding) and these were all way too weak when i mixed them in my 16 ounces water bottle.<br />I finally found that i needed to dissolve 2 packets in a small bit of hot water first (if not the tea clumped on me), and than add a packet of sweetener before adding the rest of the water just to make these palatable.<br />Over all I am very dissatisfied with the product and will stick with the other brands that are out on the market.",Negative,say love iced tea drink lot love convenience new individual serving size packet also big fan stash product rather stash product triedi purchased case variety say drink iced tea kidding way weak mixed ounce water bottlei finally found needed dissolve packet small bit hot water first tea clumped add packet sweetener adding rest water make palatableover dissatisfied product stick brand market

5,See how it stacks up against the others,"This is good syrup and my 2nd favorite.  It has a medium sweetness when compared with the other 2 that I've tried.  I typically don't like things very sweet.  I used 3 syrups listed below for my Master Cleanse.  They are all good quality and I'd recommend any of them.  You probably will want 1 jug for every 5 days of a cleanse.  It is possible that you'll need more.  I'm not an expert to comment on darkness or many other factors.

We ran out that day, so I ordered the gallon size. BIG disappointment. It did not taste like any root beer flavor I had ever tasted, no one even ate more than a third of their cup. To me, it tasted more like black licorice with a very strong aftertaste. I called Paragon and they said they cannot do anything about it, since we ordered it through Amazon. We cannot return it here because it is opened. I now realize though, that I had not seen that the gallon is labeled ""Premium"" (would of thought that meant ""even better taste"") and the quart we had purchased was labeled ""standard"".

I much prefer organic teas that are made without artificial flavorings and certainly without soy, but if you are not picky about herb teas, and are looking something very strongly flavored as an introduction to the world of teasans and decaffeinated beverages, this would be fine. If you like your tea more subtle, with true pure tastes, and can discern complex differences between natural and commercial teas, then this definitely is not for you, and I would recommend any Numi tea, Yogi Tea, Traditional Medicinals, or even Stash's organic line of teas (which comes in a wonderful Lemon Ginger Organic Tea!)<br /><br />Stash Lemon Ginger Tea contains ginger root, lemongrass, lemon flavor, safflower, hibiscus, citric acid, and soy.<br /><br />Unfortunately, nothing special.<br />***",Neutral,stash lemon ginger caffeine free herbal tea basic lemon ginger tea tasting strongly ginger full flavoring oddly even contains soy one better commercial highly processed nonorganic tea much prefer organic tea made without artificial flavoring certainly without soy picky herb tea looking something strongly flavored introduction world teasans decaffeinated beverage would fine like tea subtle true pure taste discern complex difference natural commercial tea definitely would recommend numi tea yogi tea traditional medicinals even stash organic line tea come wonderful lemon ginger organic teastash lemon ginger tea contains ginger root lemongrass lemon flavor safflower hibiscus citric acid soyunfortunately nothing special

5,"Grain-free, & the protein isn't too much too handle","**Update: March 2012**  I still feed this grain free kibble to my shelties, they still love it and I'm still very happy with it.  I've found a way to eliminate gas in my younger sheltie - mixing the dry kibble with a bit of hot water and letting it sit for 5 minutes before feeding the furry kids.  For some reason, my younger sheltie's tummy finds this easier to digest and now he doesn't have gas at all.  Woohoo!  So now I'm able to feed more of this kibble, they get twice as much of it than they used to.  I think I've been feeding this Canidae Grain Free to my dogs for almost 5 years now, and my dogs have never had an upset tummy.<br /><br />By the way, buying directly from Amazon for this item says ""Usually ships in 3 to 4 weeks"", but 1-2 days after I order I'll get an update email from Amazon saying something like ""Good news - We're able to ship this sooner than we thought!  Your item will be delivered a week from the date you ordered.""  And sure enough, it arrives within a week of ordering.<br /><br />**Original review**<br />I feed my dogs the Canidae grain-free All Life Stages food (now called Canidae pureElements, I don't think Amazon has updated the photo or name of this food yet but the ingredients haven't changed) - why the Grain Free variety?  My younger sheltie has epilepsy.  Gluten and corn are possible seizure triggers, so I feed both my shelties a wheat, corn, & gluten free diet.  Canidae is only part of that diet;  I feed them 4 small meals a day - 1/4 cup Canidae Grain Free ALS, then a 4"" piece of raw turkey neck, then veggies for the last two meals.  The last meal is sometimes another 1/4 cup of Canidae instead of veggies.  I know, it's complicated, right?  But my dogs really do better on a mostly raw diet like this.  I still use kibble because it's the fastest way to feed them a meal first thing in the morning before I let them out to go potty.<br /><br />I've fed a variety of kibbles from the natural pet food shops, some with grain and others grain free, and when I fed them an all-kibble diet (Canidae or other brands) my younger sheltie had TERRIBLE gas, while my older sheltie had anal gland problems where she'd have an anal sac blowout at least once a month.  So gross, but that's why we covered our couches in blankets that were easily washed.  (Gosh I hope you're not eating lunch while you read this review.)  Anyway, I started giving them more raw food and the gas has disappeared and my girl sheltie no longer has anal gland issues.  Their teeth are cleaner too.<br /><br />I didn't want this to turn into a ""raw food is the only way to go"" preaching session, I swear!  But for my dogs, raw is better - it's easier for my younger sheltie to digest so he doesn't gas us out of our home, and it gives my older sheltie firmer poo so her anal glands work like they're supposed to.  Canidae doesn't help my dogs' particular issues like raw does.<br /><br />However, Canidae is a heck of a lot easier and cheaper to feed, and my furry kids certainly do love Canidae's taste, they inhale it.  If your dog doesn't have weird kibble digestion issues like mine do, then Canidae Grain Free ALS is a 5 star dog food.  For my dogs' sensitive systems, it's a 4-star food.<br /><br />The Canidae Grain-Free All Life Stages has a 34% protein level, which seems to do better with my shetland sheepdogs' stomachs than the higher protein kibbles.  I've fed another brand of grain-free kibble (Innova EVO turkey & chicken) that had 42% protein which was too high for them to handle even when switching to it gradually and only getting a 1/4 cup a day... 42% protein made their poo liquid.  So, I've stuck with Canidae's grain free ALS.<br /><br />I've also done a 50/50 mix with the Grain Free ALS and the Grain Free Salmon, the furry kids love it.  The Salmon variety smells like FISH, big surprise, right?  I try not to breathe when dishing it out, don't care for the smell of fish like the pups do.<br /><br />As I write this, Amazon's price is the same as my local natural pet store.

4,Salsa Garden Seed Kit... More Work than the Herb Kit,"I purchased the Aerogarden system and a few kits last year.  On Jan 1st 2009 I took out the remnants of the herb kit and planted the Salsa Garden kit.  This particular kit has several extra steps - plant selection, pruning, growth stabilization, and pollinating.  I will mention each in detail here to help others.  The herb gardens are the easiest - just cut off what you need as you go, once mastered you might find yourself wanting to try something else.  Salsa Garden and other kits like this - i.e. Chili Pepper, Cherry Tomato, Snow Peas, Green Beans, etc. - will require a few more steps.  These steps are the main changes for Salsa kit vs Herb kit.<br /><br />1. Plant Selection -  With the Salsa Garden, you must first make a selection of the plants themselves.  After several days of growth you will see the small sprouts.  There will most likely be more than one sprout in each pod - you must cut back to just one plant per pod.  There will be only 3 pods total in this kit - 1 pepper, 2 tomato.  There will be spacers to fill in the other pod slots, this will allow growth of these plants.  Plant selection is important, so make sure not to let those extra sprouts keep growing - doing so will eventually overrun your pod space.<br /><br />2. Pruning - This kit's instruction uses the 5th branch system.  Read that section carefully before your first pruning.  Then afterwards you will continue to prune throughout the life of the plant - to prevent growth to close to the lightbulbs and to trim wandering branches that are unable to reach the light.  Eventually those branches will die and you can cut them afterwards if you accidently forget to prune them earlier.  You will continually get dead leaves, especially near the base of the plant - do not fret, this will happen a lot as the outer edge of the plant gets more of the light.<br /><br />3. Growth Stabilization - This kit will eventually require a string or twine, etc.  After your plant grows big enough, the weight of the plant will eventually cause it to begin leaning over, especially after fruit / vegetables begin to appear.  Each plant will need a string to stabilize it to the light post at the back of the Aerogarden.  I personally used 3 nylon strings that I removed from a shopping mall bag's handle, similar to that of an athletic short's draw string.  You can also get twine or other thick strings, like yarn, from almost any hardware store, crafts store or supermarket.  Some other sets like Green Bean kits have their own support devices, but for the Salsa kit you must provide your own - so be prepared.<br /><br />4. Pollinating - This might be the easiest step... or possibly not.  As each plant begins to flower, pollination by bees or insects will not be likely.  As per the instructions, you must gently shake the plants to cause the pollen to move about and eventually end up on one of the other flowers.  Read this section carefully about how vigorously you should or should not shake the plants - in my oppinion, not very much if at all.  I tried this step and it worked fine for the tomatoes, but not the peppers.  After several waves of blooms appeared on the mini jalapeno plant still no amount of shaking worked.  Eventually I tried to shake a little harder, which didn't work and also caused many of the under leaves to fall off.  My advice - use a feather.  This isn't the most practical method, but it works.  When you see several blooms open at once, lightly brush the interior of the first flower - then the second, third, etc.  Do not forget to come back and brush the first flower again at the end of the cycle.  The pollen will stick to the feather then stick back onto a different flower - similar to the hairs on an insect's legs and body.  You may have trouble finding a feather - which I recommend using a very clean one at that.  DO NOT grab a feather from a your yard that came from a wild bird or from a farm animal.  You sure don't want lice or other problems in your house.  Try a crafts store or you can pull the feather out of a cheap household duster.<br /><br />My final opinion, the tomatoes grow easily and without much trouble except for the stabilization.  The peppers on the other hand stabilize well enough and keep themselves fairly self pruned at the base, but pollinating these bad boys can be a little bit of a trick at first.  Overall this was a fun kit and it produced all the way until the end, eventually I ran out of nutrients and decided to remove the plants.  If I hadn't, they'd be still going.  I got about 5 months of produce - which over time was a lot, but I only got 2 or 3 tomatoes at a time or 1 pepper at a time for lots of those weeks in between.  This was fun, but may not be for everyone.  If you mastered the herb kit, then this would be an interesting next step.  On the other hand if you had trouble with the herb kit, then you might want to pass on the Salsa Kit.",Positive,purchased aerogarden system kit last year jan st took remnant herb kit planted salsa garden kit particular kit several extra step plant selection pruning growth stabilization pollinating mention detail help others herb garden easiest cut need go mastered might find wanting try something else salsa garden kit like ie chili pepper cherry tomato snow pea green bean etc require step step main change salsa kit v herb kit plant selection salsa garden must first make selection plant several day growth see small sprout likely one sprout pod must cut back one plant per pod pod total kit pepper tomato spacers fill pod slot allow growth plant plant selection important make sure let extra sprout keep growing eventually overrun pod space pruning kit instruction us th branch system read section carefully first pruning afterwards continue prune throughout life plant prevent growth close lightbulb trim wandering branch unable reach light eventually branch die cut afterwards accidently forget prune earlier continually get dead leaf especially near base plant fret happen lot outer edge plant get light growth stabilization kit eventually require string twine etc plant grows big enough weight plant eventually cause begin leaning especially fruit vegetable begin appear plant need string stabilize light post back aerogarden personally used nylon string removed shopping mall bag handle similar athletic short draw string also get twine thick string like yarn almost hardware store craft store supermarket set like green bean kit support device salsa kit must provide prepared pollinating might easiest step possibly plant begin flower pollination bee insect likely per instruction must gently shake plant cause pollen move eventually end one flower read section carefully vigorously shake plant oppinion much tried step worked fine tomato pepper several wave bloom appeared mini jalapeno plant still amount shaking worked eventually tried shake little harder didnt work also caused many leaf fall advice use feather isnt practical method work see several bloom open lightly brush interior first flower second third etc forget come back brush first flower end cycle pollen stick feather stick back onto different flower similar hair insect leg body may trouble finding feather recommend using clean one grab feather yard came wild bird farm animal sure dont want louse problem house try craft store pull feather cheap household dustermy final opinion tomato grow easily without much trouble except stabilization pepper hand stabilize well enough keep fairly self pruned base pollinating bad boy little bit trick first overall fun kit produced way end eventually ran nutrient decided remove plant hadnt theyd still going got month produce time lot got tomato time pepper time lot week fun may everyone mastered herb kit would interesting next step hand trouble herb kit might want pas salsa kit

5,Perfect all-purpose gluten-free flour blend,"Domata Living Flour put the joy back in my gluten-free cooking.  I was introduced to it four years ago, through a local celiac support group.  It is a cup-for-cup replacement for all-purpose flour in your own favorite recipes.  You can even use it to make a roux.  In some recipes, I find it best to add a tad more flour or a tad more liquid -- but I can tell whether I need more of either as I am mixing the ingredients.  And, with some recipes, I do need to increase the baking time as gluten-free flours do tend to take longer to bake.  I use it for cakes, cookies, muffins, bread and breading for fried foods, pie crusts and other pastries, gravies and roux, waffles, whatever.  I have noticed that foods fried with Domata Living Flour do not absorb as much oil as foods fried with all-purpose wheat flour, so they are crisper and they reheat well without turning soggy.  I don't need extra gluten for pie crusts, but you can add a tad more xanthan gum if you find that it is not quite stretchy enough for your pastry recipes.  The taste and texture are equal to all-purpose wheat flour.  Baked goods may not rise quite as much as with a wheat flour, but I find that the cakes and muffins are still the same size as they were when I made them with all-purpose wheat flour.  I have shared this with many celiacs or those who cook for celiacs, and it has been a hit with each and every one.  One note:  if you are using an old bread recipe, remember that gluten-free dough has no gluten to be developed by kneading and does not benefit from the second rise that some recipes include.  You can do either without harm, but there is no advantage to doing so.<br />This is the one gluten-free flour I must have in my kitchen.",Positive,domata living flour put joy back glutenfree cooking introduced four year ago local celiac support group cupforcup replacement allpurpose flour favorite recipe even use make roux recipe find best add tad flour tad liquid tell whether need either mixing ingredient recipe need increase baking time glutenfree flour tend take longer bake use cake cooky muffin bread breading fried food pie crust pastry gravy roux waffle whatever noticed food fried domata living flour absorb much oil food fried allpurpose wheat flour crisper reheat well without turning soggy dont need extra gluten pie crust add tad xanthan gum find quite stretchy enough pastry recipe taste texture equal allpurpose wheat flour baked good may rise quite much wheat flour find cake muffin still size made allpurpose wheat flour shared many celiacs cook celiacs hit every one one note using old bread recipe remember glutenfree dough gluten developed kneading benefit second rise recipe include either without harm advantage sothis one glutenfree flour must kitchen

This time--got a package that expires in May and the packaging was a bit different--which was fine--since it's only end of March right now--but when I opened it--the powder was stale looking (like sand)--whitish in color not the vibrant green and powder flew up in the air (like sawdust)--whereas it's usually more dense.  Too bad--my baby really liked the peas in the variety pack.,Positive,bought first time amazon week agothe variety package great starspowder fresh vibrant looking ran peasso thought id purchase againbut without variety packjust pea timegot package expires may packaging bit differentwhich finesince end march right nowbut opened itthe powder stale looking like sandwhitish color vibrant green powder flew air like sawdustwhereas usually dense badmy baby really liked pea variety pack

4,Very creative!,"What an interesting treat! Yes, you may feel the flavor of raw cacao, but this aspect is mild, and you may not even notice it if you don't focus on it. What you are more likely to notice is how elegantly it's crafted in terms of mouthfeel (both the chocolate itself and the combination of the chocolate and the filling). I think this product is a masterpiece, taste-wise and texture-wise. The only obstacles for my family to buying from this brand often are the price and the presence of some added sugar (relatively little though, judging by the numbers on their labels; I just wanted to point out that agave nectar is especially high in fructose, the ""worst"" of ""simple sugars"", and this brand uses some agave nectar - hopefully very little). This brand's other bars, Acai and ""Caramel"", are similar, but ""Maca"" is NOT chocolaty and disappointing.",Positive,interesting treat yes may feel flavor raw cacao aspect mild may even notice dont focus likely notice elegantly crafted term mouthfeel chocolate combination chocolate filling think product masterpiece tastewise texturewise obstacle family buying brand often price presence added sugar relatively little though judging number label wanted point agave nectar especially high fructose worst simple sugar brand us agave nectar hopefully little brand bar acai caramel similar maca chocolaty disappointing

5,Great option for diabetics,"This is not the same as the regular Swiss Miss, but I find it an acceptable option for diabetics.  I have this on subscription.  It's nice to be able to have a mug (use two pkg) when I make cocoa for my grandkids.  You can add a little splenda to sweeten, but I have gotten used to the less sweet flavor.  Cocoa does settle at the bottom a little, but a stir midway though would do the trick.  Although not low fat, to richen it I have added a tablespoon of half and half.  It's good added to coffee to make a mocha drink.  I rate this 5 stars as I have tried to make my own diabetic mix formula and this is so much simpler.  Not perfect, but perfect for me.",Positive,regular swiss miss find acceptable option diabetic subscription nice able mug use two pkg make cocoa grandkids add little splenda sweeten gotten used less sweet flavor cocoa settle bottom little stir midway though would trick although low fat richen added tablespoon half half good added coffee make mocha drink rate star tried make diabetic mix formula much simpler perfect perfect

4,Not for Everyone - very unique!,"We picked this up randomly in the loose tea section, and found it to be a very strong yet enjoyable tea.  This would be best served as a breakfast tea in colder weather.  To sweeten, use honey (sugars or substitutes won't taste right) and add some lemon for a very nice touch (we used lemon flavored honey which was perfect).<br /><br />The aroma and flavor are reminiscent of aged pipe tobacco.

5,Very clean taste.,"Elderberry jam or jelly is never available in stores around here anymore so I decided to look on Amazon. I ordered this Suro jam and also Mrs. Miller's Homemade elderberry jelly.  In a taste test in front of an open window the Suro jam was superior for it's pure clean elderberry essence. I was surprised that, in comparing the two, an off flavor was apparent in the Mrs. Miller's jelly, which I would describe as musty or like there was honey mixed in.  I had not picked up on this when eating the jelly on a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. Of course I am comparing an expensive jam with a less expensive jelly.  On the down side the Suro jam was a little on the thin side and the numerous seeds are a potential problem for someone with diverticulosis.",Positive,elderberry jam jelly never available store around anymore decided look amazon ordered suro jam also mr miller homemade elderberry jelly taste test front open window suro jam superior pure clean elderberry essence surprised comparing two flavor apparent mr miller jelly would describe musty like honey mixed picked eating jelly peanut butter jelly sandwich course comparing expensive jam less expensive jelly side suro jam little thin side numerous seed potential problem someone diverticulosis
3,"Advertised as Medium-Bold, but more Medium than Bold.  Slightly Bitter, but Not Harsh.","This Columbia Blend leans more to the medium side than the bold side of coffee.  However, there is a slight kick to it, so solid medium coffee drinkers may want to take a pass.<br /><br />The blend is also slightly bitter, but not so bitter that it would be considered a harsh taste.  The bitter can be toned down by milk, which would leave no significant aftertaste.<br /><br />I would put this kcup in the same category as <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G"">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a>, although I would choose this Barista Prima Columbia blend over the Caribou Blend.<br /><br />This is an OK blend, but there are better coffee blends on the market.<br /><br />Disclosure: I received this kcup in a free sample pack mailed by Keurig to its customers.",Neutral,columbia blend lean medium side bold side coffee however slight kick solid medium coffee drinker may want take passthe blend also slightly bitter bitter would considered harsh taste bitter toned milk would leave significant aftertastei would put kcup category caribou coffee caribou blend count kcups keurig brewer although would choose barista prima columbia blend caribou blendthis ok blend better coffee blend marketdisclosure received kcup free sample pack mailed keurig customer

5,Dogs Love Dingos,"I have yet to encouter a dog that doesn't enjoy Dingos. From the youngest puppy to the oldest senior, they all have loved the various Dingo bones and treat.<br /><br />The biggest challenge is buying a size big enough to prevent the dog from eating it rather than chewing it.  This is not true of all dogs, but if the dog has food or treat issues it can be a consideration.  They really lovethese treats and seem to not want to be patient or risk not getting the entire bone. And most of the dogs I have given these to also tend to want to chew them from start to finish, so I do have to take the treat away from a dog occasionally.<br /><br />There are Dingo imitators out there that cost less, but I have yet to find one that is of similar quality.

Here is a excerpt from one of the sites (I think it was from eHow.com):<br /><br />The Center for Science in the Public Interest evaluated popular brands of baby foods, including Gerbers, Heinz, Earth's Best and Beech-Nut. According to the Center's report, Earth's Best did not use starchy fillers or ""replace real food with water and thickening agents in many of their products for children over six months of age. Such adulterated products are nutritionally inferior to products made with more fruits and vegetables."" Earth's Best uses certified organic products. The brand offers single-ingredient, smooth foods for infants over four months; fruit, vegetable, grain and meat blends for babies over six months; and a variety of chunky soups, dinners and vegetable medleys for children over nine months old.

3,"Okay, Not Great","Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Fruit Punch flavor tastes okay but not great. I had three other people try this product and no one was really blown away by the taste. Two of the individuals felt like there was a slight after taste. If you like the taste it does provide vitamins B3, B6, and B12, Vitamin C, Zinc, Magnesium, Chromium, and caffeine that is about the equivalent of a can of soda.  If you are sensitive to caffeine you should stay away from this product. Also, it does contain the artificial sweetener sucralose which many people do not like and will not consume.<br /><br />It is designed for an 8 ounce serving of water although most water bottles are 16 ounces so you will need to adjust the serving amount as necessary. The bottle is large and not what I would consider portable so you may need to prepare your drink ahead of time.<br /><br />There are a lot of similar products on the market and Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink does not really distinguish itself in a crowded market. The bottle is large, not convenient to carry with you in a workout bag for the gym or backpack on a hike. And, sucralose is an artificial sweetener that I would rather avoid. This is a product that is average at best. It is far from exceptional but not terrible. It will really come down to your taste preference.",Neutral,vitamin squeeze energy drink fruit punch flavor taste okay great three people try product one really blown away taste two individual felt like slight taste like taste provide vitamin b b b vitamin c zinc magnesium chromium caffeine equivalent soda sensitive caffeine stay away product also contain artificial sweetener sucralose many people like consumeit designed ounce serving water although water bottle ounce need adjust serving amount necessary bottle large would consider portable may need prepare drink ahead timethere lot similar product market vitamin squeeze energy drink really distinguish crowded market bottle large convenient carry workout bag gym backpack hike sucralose artificial sweetener would rather avoid product average best far exceptional terrible really come taste preference

About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.""  I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand® Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff.<br />We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand® flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time.<br />Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks.  Please let me know if I can be of any more help.""  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.  Stay away from Kettle chips they are no longer the same...",Negative,loved chip chip would buy discovered england back quickly became fan year ago picked bag sale local supermarket finding odd sale much took advantage opening bag found chip even close kettle chip used uniform whitish yellow color flavor way lovely extra crisp brown chip gone completely disappointed emailed kettle following happened bought bag chip day different taste taste cheaper dont know else put also noticed chip seemed less cooked see browner colored chip flavor hoping nothing changed ingredient process used produce product get weird batch buying kettle chip year wondering receive reply thanks letting u know experience kettle brand chip sound like may received bag slipped inspection apologizeour potato vary seasonally could account variation colorbut chip still taste greatthanks providing u best code bag really help passing comment staffwe sending coupon replace purchase kettle brand flavor nut butter believing great experience next purchase case buy product suggest avoiding best date still rare instance another bag case slipped inspection timethanks letting u know expect coupon arrive within week please let know help well next bag good since time picked bag chip like bad bag pretty sure changed product reduce cost research found kettle bought private equity company cookie cutter management process probably employed kettle acquire company high quality brand recognition sell product mass merchant lower qualitycost product increase margin finally sell company customer base start realize brand longer quality brand increased profit make company valuable paper make nice profit investor customer employee lose course unsuspecting buyer exploited brand stay away kettle chip longer

5,C H I P.....C H I P.....H O O R A Y....!!!!!  :  )  ( B A C K Y A R D.....B A R B E C U E ),"I was getting VERY worried, when I read some of the other reviews here.  Specifically, the ""One Star"" reviews, to which I always go, to see if the faults these other reviewers find with any merchandise would prevent me from buying it.<br /><br />WOW!  They sure seemed to hate the KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE 9-OUNCE BAGS, (PACK OF 12), that I had bought as 1 ounce bags, liked A LOT, decided to subscribe....and then, for good measure, got 2 orders of the 9 ounce bags.<br /><br />Yes...I love potato chips....especially these KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBECUE FLAVOUR....but others seemed to really HATE them...or at least, hate how they had changed.<br />But then I realized they were talking about OTHER FLAVOURS!  Amazon, in it's deep wisdom, has obviously seen fit to put ALL comments concerning ALL flavours of KETTLE, (and other brands of?????) potato chips, TOGETHER!<br /><br />Of course, this DOES have SOME advantages, because most potato-chip lovers, (like me!), enjoy eating several flavour, and brand varieties.  So, comparisons can be made easily.  Also, as we're all potato-chip lovers, but each person has his or her very favourite flavour that they are reviewing, we are, here a sort of ""United Nations of Potato Chip Lovers""....all different, but all united in our love of Potato Chips!  (The rest of the world can REALLY benefit from the example of our tightly-knit, but ever...er,...expanding...group here, I think! : )  But -- not at first realizing that these<br />different flavour reviews were all together, did cause me a little confusion and dismay.... at least to begin with.... (Amazon should have mentioned that this is the ""Kettle Potato Chip Review Forum""! : )<br /><br />I am happy to report that KETTLE CHIPS, BACKYARD BARBEQUE FLAVOUR, are totally delicious!  (At least they are in the one-ounce bags...hopefully the same product in the 9 ounce bags will taste the same!)  These are definitely chips for ADULTS, however -- and/or children whose stronger-than-adult taste buds can withstand the very strong flavour of these chips.  They are NOT the strongest flavour I have ever had...that was from a jalapeno pepper chip which was far too strong for even me!<br />These Backyard Barbeque chips by Kettle, however, have just the right amount of sweetness, (with honey powder, onion and sugar), to take the edge of the stonger flavours<br />(paprika, chili pepper, cayenne pepper, and natural smoke flavour), of which there is less, (they come further down in the list of ingredients than the sweeteners.)<br /><br />The complete list of ingredients of these KETTLE BACKYARD BARBECUE CHIPS, (in the 1-ounce bags, and hopefully, in the 9 ounce bags as well), is as follows:<br /><br />Potatoes<br />Vegetable Oil, (Safflower and Sunflower Oil),<br />Honey Powder, (Dried cane sugar, honey),<br />Rice Powder<br />Sugar<br />Salt<br />Onion Powder<br />Tomato Powder<br />Paprika<br />Torula Yeast<br />Garlic Powder<br />Chili Pepper<br />Citric Acid<br />Cayenne Pepper<br />Paprika Oleoresin, (Colour)<br />Natural Smoke Flavour<br /><br />Naturally cooked, natural ingredients.  The combination is a true taste treat!<br /><br />Of course, as with all ptato chips, moderation is the key.<br />Potatoes contain a LOT of potassium....which gives energy and othr good things....but too much of which can damage kindneys.  The vegetable oil is great -- but too much oil, (as well as too much starch, from the potatoes), can hurt the eyes.  Natural smoke flavour is SO yummy....but it, (as well as sugar), has -- in very large amounts -- been linked to cancer production<br /><br />As far as the starch from the potatoes and oil go, this<br />can be ameliorated, (a bit), by drinking TEA...which is good for the eyes.  But as far as the potassium, (energy - good, too much -- bad for the kidneys), and the sugar and natural smoke flavour, (too much leading to cancer production) -- the only thing is to do what is good in everything.....M O D E R A T I O N...!<br /><br />Twice or three times a month, I allow myself to go on what I call a ""Potato Chip Diet"".  I eat only one large bag, (or the equivalent in small ones), of potato chips all day.  I supplement this with tea, coffee, and lemonade, as well as several servings of Carnation Instant Breakfast Essentials, (I like the Dark Chocolate flavour)  This adds up to fewer calories than I would normally eat, if I had my normal three meals a day plus snacks.  It also teaches me to eat s-l-o-w-l-y, because that one big bag, (or many little bags), never lasts as long as I'd like.  Anyway, with excercise and sensible eating, the rest of the month, (and keeping my scale nearby, and weighing myself at least twice a day, every day), I've taken off ten pounds in the last three months! : )<br /><br />These BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips from KETTLE,<br />are totally scrumptious.  Except for those jalapino chips, (which tasted good, but were far too spicy for my own taste buds), I have yet to meet a potato chip I didn't like to eat.  These Kettle BACKYARD BARBEQUE flavour potato chips, with their combination of potatoes, sweetness, and spices, have truly become one of my top five favourites....if not the VERY first favourite, of all!<br /><br />Flavoured potato PERFECTION!",Positive,getting worried read review specifically one star review always go see fault reviewer find merchandise would prevent buying itwow sure seemed hate kettle chip backyard barbecue ounce bag pack bought ounce bag liked lot decided subscribeand good measure got order ounce bagsyesi love potato chipsespecially kettle chip backyard barbecue flavourbut others seemed really hate themor least hate changedbut realized talking flavour amazon deep wisdom obviously seen fit put comment concerning flavour kettle brand potato chip togetherof course advantage potatochip lover like enjoy eating several flavour brand variety comparison made easily also potatochip lover person favourite flavour reviewing sort united nation potato chip loversall different united love potato chip rest world really benefit example tightlyknit evererexpandinggroup think first realizing thesedifferent flavour review together cause little confusion dismay least begin amazon mentioned kettle potato chip review forum happy report kettle chip backyard barbeque flavour totally delicious least oneounce bagshopefully product ounce bag taste definitely chip adult however andor child whose strongerthanadult taste bud withstand strong flavour chip strongest flavour ever hadthat jalapeno pepper chip far strong even methese backyard barbeque chip kettle however right amount sweetness honey powder onion sugar take edge stonger flavourspaprika chili pepper cayenne pepper natural smoke flavour less come list ingredient sweetenersthe complete list ingredient kettle backyard barbecue chip ounce bag hopefully ounce bag well followspotatoesvegetable oil safflower sunflower oilhoney powder dried cane sugar honeyrice powdersugarsaltonion powdertomato powderpaprikatorula yeastgarlic powderchili peppercitric acidcayenne pepperpaprika oleoresin colournatural smoke flavournaturally cooked natural ingredient combination true taste treatof course ptato chip moderation keypotatoes contain lot potassiumwhich give energy othr good thingsbut much damage kindneys vegetable oil great much oil well much starch potato hurt eye natural smoke flavour yummybut well sugar large amount linked cancer productionas far starch potato oil go thiscan ameliorated bit drinking teawhich good eye far potassium energy good much bad kidney sugar natural smoke flavour much leading cancer production thing good everythingm e r ntwice three time month allow go call potato chip diet eat one large bag equivalent small one potato chip day supplement tea coffee lemonade well several serving carnation instant breakfast essential like dark chocolate flavour add fewer calorie would normally eat normal three meal day plus snack also teach eat slowly one big bag many little bag never last long id like anyway excercise sensible eating rest month keeping scale nearby weighing least twice day every day ive taken ten pound last three month backyard barbeque flavour potato chip kettleare totally scrumptious except jalapino chip tasted good far spicy taste bud yet meet potato chip didnt like eat kettle backyard barbeque flavour potato chip combination potato sweetness spice truly become one top five favouritesif first favourite allflavoured potato perfection
4,Not the best but a good compomise.,"As I diabetic, I have to be careful of my sugar intake but love dark chocolate. I did a comparison shop at Wally World and picked up the Hershey's and Dove dark sugar free and the high (86%) but sugar-included Ghirardelli's.<br /><br />I eat chocolate by letting it slowly melt in my mouth to make it last longer and get maximum taste. Never chew on it. My conclusions:<br /><br />The Dove is noticeably smoother than the Hershey's and has smaller pieces but is more expensive and melts far too fast. I had to repeatedly check that it was dark chocolate, though because it lacks the required somewhat bitter dark taste.<br /><br />The Hershey's is very good and melts nice and slowly. It does not have as nice a taste as its sugary counterpart but comes VERY close and is worth getting.<br /><br />The Ghirardelli is true dark chocolate with the typical real dark bitter taste as it should have. However, the pieces are bigger so you have to break it up but it does melt nice and slowly.<br /><br />At a little under $2 at Wally World, the Hershey's is the best buy for the amount and taste. Amazon, your price needs to come down a bit. I'd rather buy from you but even 12 packs are higher than Wally's single bag on a per bag basis. Too bad Hershey doesn't want to provide bigger bags of this product.<br /><br />One nice thing - the sugar alcohol has a laxative effect so you tend to not overdo it or you get punished later!

3,A little different,"Contrary to the implication of the ""bold"" moniker, this sauce does not have a real strong flavor.  The jalapeno taste is subtle, which is actually a good thing for folks that like just a little bite to their sauce without having to worry about their tongues burning off.  If you are looking for a powerful hot pepper jolt, you aren't going to find it in this product. But it is a bit different of a taste, with a combination of spice and sweetness that fits with a variety of foods.<br /><br />But, at 70 calories a serving, you can accidentally pack on a lot of empty calories using this product.  Compare that to the typical taco sauce with around 10 calories per serving, and that can add up.",Neutral,contrary implication bold moniker sauce real strong flavor jalapeno taste subtle actually good thing folk like little bite sauce without worry tongue burning looking powerful hot pepper jolt arent going find product bit different taste combination spice sweetness fit variety foodsbut calorie serving accidentally pack lot empty calorie using product compare typical taco sauce around calorie per serving add

1,a total scam,"I am thorougly disgusted with Betty Crocker for this product (Gluten-free Bisquick), which is a shame, because I do applaud them for their excellent cake, cookie, and brownie mixes.<br /><br />I'm not upset with them for for coming out with a gluten-free baking mix, but for:<br /><br />#1) marketing it as though it's an equivalent to Bisquick and<br />#2) for pricing it so ridiculously high.<br /><br />Ingredients for regular Bisquick: Enriched flour, Partiallly hydrogenated soybean and/or cottonseed oil, leavening, dextrose, salt.<br /><br />Ingredients for gluten-free Bisquick:  Rice Flour, Sugar, Leavening (baking soda, sodium aluminum phosphate, monocalcium phosphate), Modified Potato Starch, Salt, Xanthan Gum<br /><br />Notice anything missing from the ingredients of gluten-free Bisquick? Yup, that's right--there's no shortening (or oil).<br /><br />That was the whole point of the original Bisquick--a baking mix that ALREADY HAD THE SHORTENING MIXED IN.  That avoids the longest and messiest step of baking things like biscuits  That is why people buy baking mixes--for that specific convenience.<br /><br />Betty Crocker has decided to leave out the shortening (or oil) altogether, even though shortening (or oil) is always naturally gluten-free. So they can't pretend it's a safety-for-celiacs factor.  It's a cost-savings to them, pure and simple.<br /><br />Here's the breakdown of what you're paying $5 a pound for:<br />rice flour (99 cents a pound at my local Asian store),<br />sugar ($2.88 for a 5 pound bag at Walmart) ,<br />potato starch (also 99 cents a pound at the Asian store),<br />baking powder ($3.19 a pound at Emergency Essentials),<br />salt ($2 for 26 ounces of Morton's),<br />xanthan gum ($10.45 for 4 ounce on Amazon).<br /><br />Yes, xanthan gum is expensive--but very, very little is needed; a 16-ounce box of gluten-free Bisquick would contain about a teaspoon of xanthan gum--maybe 20 cents' worth of xanthan gum.<br /><br />Betty Crocker is charging over 5 times what it would cost you to make their ""mix"" at home, while eliminating the major convenience factor (and cost to themselves, but not to you) of their regular baking mix.<br /><br />I don't mind their making a fair profit, especially if the product really WERE the equivalent of regular Bisquick.  But they're gouging us, and being misleading about the product.<br /><br />MAKE YOUR OWN, EASILY, AND FOR LESS THAN 20% OF WHAT THEY CHARGE!<br /><br />Since there's no oil in gluten-free Bisquick, you can easily stir up an equivalent, make 5 pounds (or more!) at a time, with very little effort, and it will keep for several months.<br /><br />Or, if you want a REAL Bisquick substitutes, betterbatter.org has a recipe on the site for a cup-for-cup substitute for Bisquick that DOES use shortening and non-fat dry milk powder.  Or you can use buttermilk powder, or even Vance's dairy-free powder.  It makes 10 cups at a time, stores well, and you don't have to use their gluten-free flour--you can use any gluten-free flour replacement you want (like rice flour and potato starch from your local Asian store, mixed with an appropriate amount of xanthan gum, about 1/2 teaspoon for every two cups).<br /><br />To find the recipe, do a google search of ""betterbatter Bisquick Substitute Master Mix.""<br /><br />Boo on Betty Crocker.",Negative,thorougly disgusted betty crocker product glutenfree bisquick shame applaud excellent cake cookie brownie mixesim upset coming glutenfree baking mix marketing though equivalent bisquick pricing ridiculously highingredients regular bisquick enriched flour partiallly hydrogenated soybean andor cottonseed oil leavening dextrose saltingredients glutenfree bisquick rice flour sugar leavening baking soda sodium aluminum phosphate monocalcium phosphate modified potato starch salt xanthan gumnotice anything missing ingredient glutenfree bisquick yup thats righttheres shortening oilthat whole point original bisquicka baking mix already shortening mixed avoids longest messiest step baking thing like biscuit people buy baking mixesfor specific conveniencebetty crocker decided leave shortening oil altogether even though shortening oil always naturally glutenfree cant pretend safetyforceliacs factor costsavings pure simpleheres breakdown youre paying pound forrice flour cent pound local asian storesugar pound bag walmart potato starch also cent pound asian storebaking powder pound emergency essentialssalt ounce mortonsxanthan gum ounce amazonyes xanthan gum expensivebut little needed ounce box glutenfree bisquick would contain teaspoon xanthan gummaybe cent worth xanthan gumbetty crocker charging time would cost make mix home eliminating major convenience factor cost regular baking mixi dont mind making fair profit especially product really equivalent regular bisquick theyre gouging u misleading productmake easily less chargesince there oil glutenfree bisquick easily stir equivalent make pound time little effort keep several monthsor want real bisquick substitute betterbatterorg recipe site cupforcup substitute bisquick use shortening nonfat dry milk powder use buttermilk powder even vances dairyfree powder make cup time store well dont use glutenfree flouryou use glutenfree flour replacement want like rice flour potato starch local asian store mixed appropriate amount xanthan gum teaspoon every two cupsto find recipe google search betterbatter bisquick substitute master mixboo betty crocker

The Lipton's was pretty good, a bit sweet, though, and I'm not a fan of Aspertame.  This brand tastes nearly perfect, and it uses Splenda for sweetening instead of Aspertame.

Yummy and so delicious.  I've purchased twice, first at near $13-each for two, then near $5-each for six of them - chalk it up to when you're buying!  I should make clear that I do not regret my initial purchase, I was merely showing an example when timing can play a part in the value of this kind of transaction.  Please allow me to elaborate that I initially selected Chadwell Retail sellers as I was trying the product, and it seemed reasonable given the value for two to select them to complete my purchase.

5,My Tea Addiction...,"This is my absolute favorite tea; in the cooler months I have a cup every night after dinner. It has a natural sweetness so I have never added sugar and it doesn't need any milk either. It has a warm, spicy taste reminiscent of fireballs candies but without the ""bite"" or sugary taste. I find it fills that after dinner craving for something sweet without caving in and having dessert. This tea has such a nice balance and depth to it; I can't be without it. I am moving out of the country for a few years and panicked when I thought I could end up without my stash so I stocked up with a year's supply and will get more when I come home for the holidays.",Positive,absolute favorite tea cooler month cup every night dinner natural sweetness never added sugar doesnt need milk either warm spicy taste reminiscent fireball candy without bite sugary taste find fill dinner craving something sweet without caving dessert tea nice balance depth cant without moving country year panicked thought could end without stash stocked year supply get come home holiday

5,A yummy quick lunch,"Nong Shim noodle bowls are a definite step up in quality from the typical cup noodles.  They are simple to prepare: just add boiling water and let sit for about 3 minutes (I prefer my noodles a bit softer and let them sit at least 5 minutes).  The bowls provide a generous amount of noodles to make a filling lunch.  The Spicy Chicken variety is my favorite so far (better than the Beef & Ginger).  The broth is fairly spicy but not too much for the average palate.  Along with the noodles, there are pieces of dehydrated vegetables as well as chicken pieces.  The chicken pieces taste ok but are spongy and look kind of disgusting; I have thought about picking them out before adding the water but haven't bothered.  As other reviewers have noted, the bowls are high in sodium; however, you can use less of the seasoning packet if that is a concern.  For the price, these noodle bowls are a real winner, and they have become a frequent work-time lunch for me.<br /><br />I should note that when I ordered then from here, the case was slightly crushed and about 1/3 of the bowls were somewhat smashed.  Fortunately, the bowls were not broken and did not leak; however, because they were uneven in depth, not all the noodles were submerged in water, so they cooked unevenly.  I'm sure Amazon would have allowed me to return the bowls, but it seemed like too much hassle.",Positive,nong shim noodle bowl definite step quality typical cup noodle simple prepare add boiling water let sit minute prefer noodle bit softer let sit least minute bowl provide generous amount noodle make filling lunch spicy chicken variety favorite far better beef ginger broth fairly spicy much average palate along noodle piece dehydrated vegetable well chicken piece chicken piece taste ok spongy look kind disgusting thought picking adding water havent bothered reviewer noted bowl high sodium however use less seasoning packet concern price noodle bowl real winner become frequent worktime lunch mei note ordered case slightly crushed bowl somewhat smashed fortunately bowl broken leak however uneven depth noodle submerged water cooked unevenly im sure amazon would allowed return bowl seemed like much hassle

And note that I mention money, because I hope you have a lot of it if you want to buy some of this delicious salsa. I don't know why it's so expensive, but I guess mouth-kicking, life-changing flavor like this only comes from tomatoes hand-roasted by magical elves, and magical elves don't come cheap.

5,Excellent chips!,"These chips are always good!  They are not your normal chip, and do not have the greasy-ness about them.  They are light and crunchy and much healthier than your regular chip.  Most people really like them once they try them and get over the 'Oh, it's a HEALTH food' thing!  They are not as healthy as eating fruits and veggies, and are still chips, but they are a much MORE healthy alternative to your regular chip.  And they do still have an excellent taste!

5,"Takes time to appreciate, then WOW!","At first sip, I thought the Lipton Herbal Blackberry Vanilla Tea tasted too much like cherry cough medicine, with the blackberry-vanilla flavor just a bit too strident and artificial tasting. Kind of like overloaded hazelnut coffee. On second taste, I fell in love with this, feeling like it had a sustaining and alluring flavor. I can't explain why it feels sustaining, as it is caffeine free, perhaps the richness of flavor is at work.<br /><br />I triangulated with my housemates on this:<br /><br />Housemate the 1st: ""It has an interesting back note.""<br /><br />Housemate the 2nd (an oratorical type): ""It revives a feeling of nostalgia. It's not very tinged, not a wake-up coffee, it's a very mild tea. This is very, very good. This kind of tea leaves a taste on your taste buds, and doesn't stick to your teeth. I'm going to heat another cup.""<br /><br />So -- this is certainly worth a try if you like fun brassy flavors in tea. It contains real hibiscus flowers, rose hips, sweet blackberry leaves, dried black currant pieces, dried blackberry pieces, dried blueberry pieces and sunflower lecithin. It comes in an infusion pyramid rather than a paper bag, somewhat more tricky to compost but not a big deal.",Positive,first sip thought lipton herbal blackberry vanilla tea tasted much like cherry cough medicine blackberryvanilla flavor bit strident artificial tasting kind like overloaded hazelnut coffee second taste fell love feeling like sustaining alluring flavor cant explain feel sustaining caffeine free perhaps richness flavor worki triangulated housemate thishousemate st interesting back notehousemate nd oratorical type revives feeling nostalgia tinged wakeup coffee mild tea good kind tea leaf taste taste bud doesnt stick teeth im going heat another cupso certainly worth try like fun brassy flavor tea contains real hibiscus flower rose hip sweet blackberry leaf dried black currant piece dried blackberry piece dried blueberry piece sunflower lecithin come infusion pyramid rather paper bag somewhat tricky compost big deal

5,Excellent and easy to do.,"Really the easiest curry ever! I give it 5 stars even though it needed a few things added to bring it up a notch, I added Coconut milk to it at the end as well as a thai chili to kick it up some. I always add cilantro add the end as well. I also have used cream near end to give it a richer and creamier curry taste. It really takes out a lot of the work for you and tastes just as good as if making it from scratch. It works for breast as well as thigh meat, you just need more time for the boneless thigh meat to cook. The cooking directions are very precise and if using breast meat, you really should follow the recipe exactly as far as the method and time goes. For thighs you must wing it and figure at least 10-15 more minutes...it's hard to overcook the thigh, they are very forgiving. A great product to have in pantry.",Positive,really easiest curry ever give star even though needed thing added bring notch added coconut milk end well thai chili kick always add cilantro add end well also used cream near end give richer creamier curry taste really take lot work taste good making scratch work breast well thigh meat need time boneless thigh meat cook cooking direction precise using breast meat really follow recipe exactly far method time go thigh must wing figure least minutesits hard overcook thigh forgiving great product pantry

2,There are better choices.,"I thought I could save some money by buying in bulk. Unfortunately, I made a disappointing mistake. Compared to other stevia extracts, I found this to be a very mediocre product. I found its potency to be very weak. To get the sweetness I like, I have to use about 4 times the amount of my favorite stevia, and then the aftertaste becomes too bitter. The stevia extract that I really like begins with a K.

I was able to produce enough for the twins up to 5 months without needing any supplements, so it is not a situtation where I went from little production to a lot.

3,Carbonated watermelon juice in a can,"I found this drink interesting in terms of taste; it is watermelon juice infused with carbonation, and a burst of strawberry.

4,One of my favorite,"I absolutely love the flavor of the Kind bars, and this one is my favorite.  For people complaining about the fat.....NUTS HAVE FAT.  But that is the only source of fat in these bars.  Nuts are also full of vitamins and minerals..oh yes and PROTEIN.  These actually do taste like candy, and are a great pick me up snack.  If you want something filling though, and more of a meal replacement...go with Clif bars.  They can keep you going for quite awhile.  My real complaint with these?  The price.  No matter where you get them, they are on the high end.  I have 4 children and I cannot afford to keep these around as a regular staple.  Even buying directly, you have to get them in cases of 72..for over a 100 bucks.  Larabars if I am savvy I can get for about 1.00 a bar, and even though the texture is different (since they pretty much pulverize the nuts) are awesome and simple healthy organic, non GMO, gluten free, raw diet, vegan, most are lactose free variety's, and if the word peanut is not in the ingredients they were made in a non-peanut plant.

However, I don't find the amount of Splenda excessive. I find it just right. Most importantly, the almonds are huge and fresh and perfectly roasted. The cap also makes a handy serving size.

All of my 5 cats enjoy the flavor (organic turkey) and come running when it is time to eat.  I feed them Newman's Own organic dry cat food as well, so their diet is about half and half.  I have one cat that suffers from IBS. She has to take prednisone daily, so I'm hoping the change in food will improve her condition.  Though Newman's products are expensive, I believe the organic ingredients will make a big difference in my cats' overall health, which in turn will mean fewer trips to the vet and more money in my pocket.  Besides that, I love the fact that there is strict quality control and oversight in everything that goes into a can or a bag, and all the proceeds from the sale of Newman's Own pet food are donated back to animal shelters and the SPCA.  No profit to me means that this company really does have the cats' welfare at heart.",Positive,tried literally everything high end low end settling newman reason cat enjoy flavor organic turkey come running time eat feed newman organic dry cat food well diet half half one cat suffers ibs take prednisone daily im hoping change food improve condition though newman product expensive believe organic ingredient make big difference cat overall health turn mean fewer trip vet money pocket besides love fact strict quality control oversight everything go bag proceeds sale newman pet food donated back animal shelter spca profit mean company really cat welfare heart

I'm thinking this has to be the real thing because it fits the profile on everything i've read. it is very smooth, rich, low acidity and almost no bitterness. does this mean a weaker coffee? at first sip i thought it may, but it most certainly did not, it was so good i had a second cup and felt like i had had an espresso shortly there after. seem to fit the profile and it is soooo goood! me and my wife love it! we will be ordering more for sure. and i love the little burlap sack it comes in, too cool!",Positive,never seen blue mountain rightly say fact yes real dealhowever reading famous coffee decided try initially little skeptical paying much coffee never beforebut decided roll dice anyways im pretty sure got burned first time around went gave one try came amazon time ordered lb wallenford whole bean arrived within week im west coastand put burr grinder french press im thinking real thing fit profile everything ive read smooth rich low acidity almost bitterness mean weaker coffee first sip thought may certainly good second cup felt like espresso shortly seem fit profile soooo goood wife love ordering sure love little burlap sack come cool

3,Nothing to get excited about,"My wife is the member of our household who eats cereal of this sort. She eats shredded wheat and other cereals I personally don't care for, so I considered her my primary resource for an opinion on the consuming side of this cereal. Her viewpoint was that it wasn't bad, but it was a bit too sweet.<br /><br />Looking at the nutrition label, I can see why. While it does have whole grain oats, ingredients three through five are sugars. That is why a cup of this cereal comes in at 210 calories per cup, which far higher than I like to see in a cup of healthy cereal. This cereal is definitely off the list if you are trying to lose weight.<br /><br />If you are currently maintaining a healthy weight and have the room in your daily calorie budget, then this cereal wouldn't be a mistake if you like it. However, Kellog's Cinnamon Oat Fiber Plus cereal ALSO has whole grain oats, and almost double the fiber content of these Quaker Oatmeal squares. It has less sugar. The only downside in comparing the two is that this cereal has more protein. However, it is more common to have trouble getting enough fiber in your diet than it is to get enough protein.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this product for most people.",Neutral,wife member household eats cereal sort eats shredded wheat cereal personally dont care considered primary resource opinion consuming side cereal viewpoint wasnt bad bit sweetlooking nutrition label see whole grain oat ingredient three five sugar cup cereal come calorie per cup far higher like see cup healthy cereal cereal definitely list trying lose weightif currently maintaining healthy weight room daily calorie budget cereal wouldnt mistake like however kellogs cinnamon oat fiber plus cereal also whole grain oat almost double fiber content quaker oatmeal square less sugar downside comparing two cereal protein however common trouble getting enough fiber diet get enough proteini recommend product people

3,An Apple A Day...,"Now, I'm already a big fan of Red Leaf Tea's green apple matcha, but that one really does taste like a green apple, tart and sweet all at the same time. Which is great, but every once in a while a girl needs a smoother apple, a juicer, sweeter apple, which is what I hope to gain from this matcha. I'm eager to try it as a latte with vanilla soy milk and some of their Cinnamon Matcha...I'm hoping for a apple pie with ice cream kind of drink. I love apples and apple juice, so whenever I spot an apple blend, I have to try it. And there are so many things you can do with apple that I'm hoping to be able to do with this apple matcha. Apple matcha pie, anyone? Or apple fritters with an apple matcha icing...yes, please! I make homemade donuts occasionally...can you imagine a big apple cake donut covered in cinnamon sugar? I may have to make donuts in the near future. I hope this matcha lives up to all of the plans I have for it. And I hope it gives me the energy to follow through on those plans! Because now that I've mentioned it, if I don't make donuts in the near future, my wife will be devastated.<br /><br />Unfortunately, this is just not for me. The smell of the dry matcha has the smell of the more bitter matchas I've had from Red Leaf Tea, and that smell carried through into the taste of the brewed tea. It tastes something like apple candy when you power through the bitterness, which is nice, but far from the apple juice I was craving. I'm not an apple candy type of girl, unless it's a sour apple. It might still be good as a latte, but I won't be cooking with it, sadly. Still it isn't terrible, and the bitterness seems to fade over time. Maybe it will still hold up to donuts, as the amount of sugar in them will balance out the bitterness. I don't really think this is one I need to get more of, and if any of my local friends want a taste, I'm happy to share. I'll experiment with what I have left, maybe I can find a way to fall in love with this tea. But personally I'm going to stick with the Green Apple matcha, also from Red Leaf Teas.",Neutral,im already big fan red leaf tea green apple matcha one really taste like green apple tart sweet time great every girl need smoother apple juicer sweeter apple hope gain matcha im eager try latte vanilla soy milk cinnamon matchaim hoping apple pie ice cream kind drink love apple apple juice whenever spot apple blend try many thing apple im hoping able apple matcha apple matcha pie anyone apple fritter apple matcha icingyes please make homemade donut occasionallycan imagine big apple cake donut covered cinnamon sugar may make donut near future hope matcha life plan hope give energy follow plan ive mentioned dont make donut near future wife devastatedunfortunately smell dry matcha smell bitter matchas ive red leaf tea smell carried taste brewed tea taste something like apple candy power bitterness nice far apple juice craving im apple candy type girl unless sour apple might still good latte wont cooking sadly still isnt terrible bitterness seems fade time maybe still hold donut amount sugar balance bitterness dont really think one need get local friend want taste im happy share ill experiment left maybe find way fall love tea personally im going stick green apple matcha also red leaf tea

Hard to explain since I don't know what to compare them too. I guess I would call them light and fluffy and yet nice and crisp with a great natural flavor.<br /><br /> These have taken some of the guilt out of eating this type of snack for me. I love potato chips but they are loaded with lots of unhealthy things. I'm not saying these are healthy, just a lot less unhealthy than chips.<br /><br /> For starters these are all natural with very little fat and fairly low in carbs for a food of this type. My sugar is high but I feel comfortable eating these in moderation since the carbs are lower than chips.<br /><br />  I originally bought the variety pack so I could try them all, and I liked them all although somewhat partial to the Cheddar. It's just a matter of what mood I am in as to which one I'll choose.<br /> Unfortunately they are a bit pricy if you don't get them on sale. I just wish these came in a larger bag as opposed to the individual servings which are always more expensive.<br /><br /> Everyone has a different idea of good, so this is something you are going to have to try for yourself to decide.",Positive,hey thing taste good first thought would like pringles dont care hard explain since dont know compare guess would call light fluffy yet nice crisp great natural flavor taken guilt eating type snack love potato chip loaded lot unhealthy thing im saying healthy lot less unhealthy chip starter natural little fat fairly low carbs food type sugar high feel comfortable eating moderation since carbs lower chip originally bought variety pack could try liked although somewhat partial cheddar matter mood one ill choose unfortunately bit pricy dont get sale wish came larger bag opposed individual serving always expensive everyone different idea good something going try decide

4,A very nice mild green tea,"I love Japanese green tea and had read that gyokuro is the finest variety, so I decided to splurge on this tea. The tea is very nice, but not worth the price (in my opinion) compared to other sencha teas at a quarter of the price. I prefer a tea that brews bright green with a distinct grassy taste. This tea (using 1.5 teaspoons with 8 oz. of 175°F water and brewing for for 3 minutes) brewed tea with a faint green hue and a delicate, mild flavor. The flavor was fresh and sweet but not as bold as I had hoped. As one would expect, a second infusion (brewed for 4 minutes) was even weaker and only beneficial if one is being frugal (or wants to avoid the caffeine that is mostly extracted in the first infusion).",Positive,love japanese green tea read gyokuro finest variety decided splurge tea tea nice worth price opinion compared sencha tea quarter price prefer tea brew bright green distinct grassy taste tea using teaspoon oz f water brewing minute brewed tea faint green hue delicate mild flavor flavor fresh sweet bold hoped one would expect second infusion brewed minute even weaker beneficial one frugal want avoid caffeine mostly extracted first infusion

I have tasted their champagne and chardonnay so far and both of those were good. But I'll never buy this Merlot again.

5,Love these,"Deep, dark, rich flavor. I appreciate the reduced packaging which is environmentally friendly, and as a side benefit takes up less space.  What I really like about these, besides the great flavor (best tasting K-cups I've found so far) is that there is just the filter on the bottom. I've always had some un-addressed concerns about the composition of the plastic that other k-cups are made of, and what may be leaching into my beverage from the hot water passing over the coffee.  Look for these at costco where a 80 pack is 25$ (look around, not all stores carry them), but even on amazon it's a good deal with shipping included.",Positive,deep dark rich flavor appreciate reduced packaging environmentally friendly side benefit take less space really like besides great flavor best tasting kcups ive found far filter bottom ive always unaddressed concern composition plastic kcups made may leaching beverage hot water passing coffee look costco pack look around store carry even amazon good deal shipping included

3,Weak Flavor. High Sodium. Low Quality.,"Fortunately, I've never been gluten sensitive, at least as far as I know, but I've got a couple friends that are on gluten-free diets. This seems to be one of those things that wasn't even recognized a couple decades ago and now everyone seems to be worried about gluten. Gosh, I was at a nearby Fresh and Easy Neighborhood Market the other day and found that they even had a gluten-free section with all kinds of gluten-free products. I was amazed. I looked over the selection and decided to try a can of the Gluten Free Cafe Chicken Noodle Soup. I was very disappointed with the soup. First of all, the picture on the can shows an abundance of chicken and noodles. In reality, the broth is by far the main constituent of the can.  When you empty the entire can into a bowl, the chicken, noodles and vegetables don't even show. The chicken is somewhat dry, tough and woody and lacks good flavor. The noodles strike me as being badly overcooked, at least for my taste. The flavor of the broth is weak and the sodium content is high. Gosh, I had a can of this soup (not a very fulfilling meal) and took in about 60% of my daily value of sodium. I suppose this might be an appropriate item if you have gluten problems, but I don't. There are a lot better Chicken Noodle soups around if you aren't worried about the gluten problem.<br /><br />Gary Peterson",Neutral,fortunately ive never gluten sensitive least far know ive got couple friend glutenfree diet seems one thing wasnt even recognized couple decade ago everyone seems worried gluten gosh nearby fresh easy neighborhood market day found even glutenfree section kind glutenfree product amazed looked selection decided try gluten free cafe chicken noodle soup disappointed soup first picture show abundance chicken noodle reality broth far main constituent empty entire bowl chicken noodle vegetable dont even show chicken somewhat dry tough woody lack good flavor noodle strike badly overcooked least taste flavor broth weak sodium content high gosh soup fulfilling meal took daily value sodium suppose might appropriate item gluten problem dont lot better chicken noodle soup around arent worried gluten problemgary peterson

5,Great Drink Product Plus Lower in Calories Than Most,"I happened to try this at Whole Foods one day and I was very pleasantly surprised.  This is a terrific little drink and if you put it into a glass over ice, it looks great too.  Consider using it at any parties for friends who do not drink alcohol.  They will love it. My husband is one of these people and I know it is now his party drink of choice.  I love the flavor of both pomegranate juice and limeade.  This is combined with sparkling water and the result is a drink that is very light, refreshing and not heavy on sugar.  It is 90 calories for the can and it is very satisfying.  It will give you that energy boost with no caffeine.  I actually like this better than limeade now which quite surprised me as I like limeade very well.  I am trying to make my own to bring down the price further but so far I haven't gotten close.  I have a feeling I will just keep buying it.  A pack of 4 at Whole Foods is five bucks. I picked up a pack of this company's mango version of this drink.  It was ok but not nearly as good as this.",Positive,happened try whole food one day pleasantly surprised terrific little drink put glass ice look great consider using party friend drink alcohol love husband one people know party drink choice love flavor pomegranate juice limeade combined sparkling water result drink light refreshing heavy sugar calorie satisfying give energy boost caffeine actually like better limeade quite surprised like limeade well trying make bring price far havent gotten close feeling keep buying pack whole food five buck picked pack company mango version drink ok nearly good
2,Inferior Quality Saffron,"My family has always used saffron to flavor rice dishes, stews, desserts and even drinks.<br />I bought this product because it was a good bargain. La Mancha Spanish saffron, however, lacks the deep warm flavor and aroma of saffron.

5,Perfect for the sporting dog,"I have a 2 1/2 year old 60 pound German wirehair pointer.  We feed this food during hunting season due to his increased metabolic needs.  He burns so many calories, he eats 8 cups of this food a day (with zeal).  We use the large bites to help keep the tarter and plaque off of his teeth (and to slow his eating).  Due to the high quality of this food, he can keep up his energy, keep his weight up, and recover more quickly from scrapes/bumps from running the field.  Our vet's exact words were, ""Your dog is an example of perfect health.""  You may think the price on this food is high, but it is worth it.  You get what you pay for.  Also, consider the canned version of this food.  It is a nice way to feed/hydrate a dog after a long day hunting - just give them an hour to settle down first.  On a side note, we feed Diamond Naturals Beef and Rice in the off season.  We have no digestive issues transitioning from one to the other (we switch over a period of a few weeks).",Positive,year old pound german wirehair pointer feed food hunting season due increased metabolic need burn many calorie eats cup food day zeal use large bite help keep tarter plaque teeth slow eating due high quality food keep energy keep weight recover quickly scrapesbumps running field vet exact word dog example perfect health may think price food high worth get pay also consider canned version food nice way feedhydrate dog long day hunting give hour settle first side note feed diamond natural beef rice season digestive issue transitioning one switch period week

4,Very mild tasting coffee,"If you like your coffee to give you a strong rush of caffeine jolt with a dark roasted bitter taste (like most Starbucks), then this coffee may not be for you. If you like milder tasting coffee that has bit more aroma and taste, then this coffee may fill your needs. Starbucks this coffee isn't, and that isn't necessary a bad thing.<br /><br />I recommend everyone try this brand of coffee at least once. It was ranked #1 by one consumer magazine as the best coffee.<br /><br />I do like the taste of this coffee. Even though it is a French Roast, it tastes almost like a Hazelnut with very nutty flavor. The natural and pleasant flavor of the coffee isn't drown out by the bitter taste.<br /><br />The caffeine rush is also very mild and subtle. If you find yourself too hyper from drinking Starbucks, then this could be a good alternative brand.<br /><br />This coffee is also surprisngly affordable.

1,This espresso machine looks pretty and makes horrible espresso,"This expresso machine is horrible... my last machine belonged to my parents and was gifted to me, it lasted over 20 years, it made consistent espresso and was wonderful, not saeco brand.. when it died I decided to put some money into replacing it with a nice machine hoping that it would last years, and make wonderful lattes. I make lattes 2 times a day and always use Starbucks coffee beans fresh and kept in the freezer until use. From the day it arrived, this machine made horrible coffee... but since I ordered it from Amazon and spent over 800 after shipping on it I decided to give it a while to see if I could get it to work better. I adjusted the grind, and the dose and tried over and over. What I found is that the espresso was very inconsistent, the red error light would go off multiple times during use. Sometimes it would make a somewhat decent shot of espresso and then I would adjust nothing and the next time it would shoot out watery crap, or it would drip out half a shot and stop. It has been so infuriating. Finally after a month I called customer service to complain they told me I should be priming the pump with each use of the machine... which I tried, for about 2 cups I thought it was fixed then I was back to square one. Now after another month I am at my wits end. I wake up every morning hope it's going to make a decent cup, and end up drinking a watery cup of awful latte... grumpy until I decide to purchase a latte somewhere later in the day. I'm done hoping, like my husband says you can piss in one hand and wish in the other and see which one fills up first.. Today I am calling to return this awful piece of junk... and hopefully I will at least get my money back. Never will I purchase another product from this company, what a disappointment. If you at all like espresso you will be displeased with this machine.",Negative,expresso machine horrible last machine belonged parent gifted lasted year made consistent espresso wonderful saeco brand died decided put money replacing nice machine hoping would last year make wonderful latte make latte time day always use starbucks coffee bean fresh kept freezer use day arrived machine made horrible coffee since ordered amazon spent shipping decided give see could get work better adjusted grind dose tried found espresso inconsistent red error light would go multiple time use sometimes would make somewhat decent shot espresso would adjust nothing next time would shoot watery crap would drip half shot stop infuriating finally month called customer service complain told priming pump use machine tried cup thought fixed back square one another month wit end wake every morning hope going make decent cup end drinking watery cup awful latte grumpy decide purchase latte somewhere later day im done hoping like husband say piss one hand wish see one fill first today calling return awful piece junk hopefully least get money back never purchase another product company disappointment like espresso displeased machine
4,I like it mixed half and half with Cheerios to make less sweet,"Cinnamon Toast Crunch consists of small squares of wheat and rice covered with cinnamon and sugar. Because of the rice content, when immersed in milk, one can hear ""snap"" sounds coming from it, similar to Rice Krispies. I love cinnamon so I always try any cereal that has cinnamon in it. I find Cinnamon Roast Crunch a bit too sweet for my taste by itself. However, I found a way to make it just right. To make it less sweet I mix it half and half with Cheerios cereal (which has 1 gram of sugar per serving). In that mixture I find it pleasant to taste and not sugary.<br /><br />One serving of Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal (¾ cup or 31 g) has 130 calories or 170 calories with ½ cup of skim milk. A single serving has 3 g of total fat, no cholesterol, 220 mg of sodium and 45 mg of potassium. One serving has 25 g of total carbohydrates with 2 g of dietary fiber, 10 g of sugars, 13 g of other carbohydrates, 1 g of protein.",Positive,cinnamon toast crunch consists small square wheat rice covered cinnamon sugar rice content immersed milk one hear snap sound coming similar rice krispies love cinnamon always try cereal cinnamon find cinnamon roast crunch bit sweet taste however found way make right make less sweet mix half half cheerio cereal gram sugar per serving mixture find pleasant taste sugaryone serving cinnamon toast crunch cereal cup g calorie calorie cup skim milk single serving g total fat cholesterol mg sodium mg potassium one serving g total carbohydrate g dietary fiber g sugar g carbohydrate g protein
4,MY FIRST TASTE OF STARBUCKS COFFEE :),My town doesn't have a Starbucks so this was my first taste. I must say it has the best brewing aroma of any coffee I have tried so far. The taste was mellow and pleasant. The vanilla is not to strong like some can be. I was very happy that they use fair trade so that the coffee growers get a fair price and the the farming methods are earth friendly.<br /><br />Another perk is when the bag is empty you can take it to a Starbucks and get a free 12 oz brewed coffee. It has to be redeemed within 30 days of the best buy date on the package.<br /><br />It's good coffee. Not a lot of fluff to say about coffee.

One is my elderly father-in-law and he mentions it every time we talk to him on the pnone.  He is an avid gardener and the Aerogarden has given him a lovely winter crop of lettuce for the last 2 months and is still going strong.  He said it is easy to set up and is a subject of conversation when people come to visit.  The second purchase was at the request of my father-in-law for my niece.  She is also in a cold climate and the Aerogarden is a bright spot of green in her kitchen with a fine crop of herbs growing that she enjoys using in cooking.  She also has 2 small children who are getting an education in aero-hydroponic gardening.

3,Works As Advertised,"As a rabid, unrepentant coffee-drinker, I had to try this product.  Although I love the flavor and texture of French roast coffee, it's acidity tends to wreak havoc once inside of me.  Given my (minimum) two-cup a day habit, coffee can be tough going, to say the least.<br /><br />The Puroast brand delivered on the caffeine, but I found the flavor to be a bit bland, both straight and with cream.  I generally like my French roast to be strong, sharp and over-powering (so as to awaken me with a jolt and keep me fully hyped up), but the flip-side of this is typically very high acid content with the usual medical complaints.  To achieve that same full sensory experience, I had to use a bit more of it- about 1.5 times the usual amount of grounds that I brew of typical French roast in order to achieve a similar 'kick' from the coffee.<br /><br />In passing, I also like to spice up my coffee with either 1) a little cinnamon and Kahlua (usually during winter) or 2) one part twenty-year aged rum, minimum two parts Grand Marnier, chasing both with a strong batch of French roast filled to the rim of the mug (a kind of after-dinner dessert on the weekends for me).  I tried the latter recipe with and without a touch of cream, and while typically the coffee tends to eclipse the flavor of the alcohol mix, with Puroast both the aroma and taste of the aged rum and the Gran Marnier came through right nice as my ever-so-sensible British friends are fond of saying.  I also found that for best results with the combo of aged rum and Grand Marnier, Nestle's Coffee Mate French Vanilla product provided the best results, which featured a smooth, even finish combined with a creaminess that was, well, positively orgasmic!<br /><br />In sum, this product is an adequate and satisfying entry to the coffee space, and I highly recommend it to those who literally cannot 'stomach' their coffee.",Neutral,rabid unrepentant coffeedrinker try product although love flavor texture french roast coffee acidity tends wreak havoc inside given minimum twocup day habit coffee tough going say leastthe puroast brand delivered caffeine found flavor bit bland straight cream generally like french roast strong sharp overpowering awaken jolt keep fully hyped flipside typically high acid content usual medical complaint achieve full sensory experience use bit time usual amount ground brew typical french roast order achieve similar kick coffeein passing also like spice coffee either little cinnamon kahlua usually winter one part twentyyear aged rum minimum two part grand marnier chasing strong batch french roast filled rim mug kind afterdinner dessert weekend tried latter recipe without touch cream typically coffee tends eclipse flavor alcohol mix puroast aroma taste aged rum gran marnier came right nice eversosensible british friend fond saying also found best result combo aged rum grand marnier nestle coffee mate french vanilla product provided best result featured smooth even finish combined creaminess well positively orgasmicin sum product adequate satisfying entry coffee space highly recommend literally stomach coffee
1,Disappointed in STASH PREMIEUM TEA,"STASH PREMIUM TEA has little to no taste, depending on the flavor used.  The Decaf Chocolate Hazelnut Tea has absolutely NO flavor even when I try 3 tea bags to a cup of boiling water. I purchased 6 - 18 count boxes.  I had tried a hot chocolate tea in one of our little delis and it was wonderful.  I don't remember the name of the tea.  I don't know if this is common for STASH tea or if I received an old batch.

5,Excellent Thai-flavored chip,"I was hesitant to buy this at my local grocery store, Lunds, but they were on sale, so I bought a bag.  I've found that going beyond the simply-flavored chips, like cheddar or vinegar, usually results in disappointment.  Tried the Thai or asian-inspired chips by Target, Archer Farms, and they were awful.  These Kettle Spicy Thai chips are just awesome...so much so, that I'm considering buying them in bulk from Amazon.  The taste is complicated and stimulates different parts of the palate.  The taste sensations prevalent in real Thai food is baked into this chip...sweet, salty, spicy.  Was sour in there too?

5,Good spicy tea,"This tea is a must for people who like a flavored tea.  It has enough spice to taste but not overpowering.  It works quickly and easily in my Keurig K-Cup coffee maker.

3,"Tastes good, but...","This tea tastes good, but it is very finely ground and some of that ends up in the cup.  I like to use the same tea k-cup 2-3 times to make iced tea and with Twinnigs it doesn't work because there is so little tea in the k-cup (I suppose that's why it is so finely ground - so they can use less) that it ends up too dilute.  With Timothy's Earl Grey, on the other hand, there is much more tea in the k-cup which allows for my reuse of 2-3 times and the grounds don't end up in the cup.  The taste is about the same except you get more for your money with Timothys.",Neutral,tea taste good finely ground end cup like use tea kcup time make iced tea twinnigs doesnt work little tea kcup suppose thats finely ground use less end dilute timothy earl grey hand much tea kcup allows reuse time ground dont end cup taste except get money timothy
3,Just hot,"This is an ok hot sauce. I read the ingredients and thought it would add a bit of sweet to help balance the hotness. First ingredient is peppers. Ok, great. It's what I expected. Second ingredient is sugar. Ahhhh, that's good, too. The problem? There is no sweetness at all. I was hoping for a really nice blend of the two but it just isn't here. Don't believe I'll be buying this again. But, as a 'disclaimer', it IS hot sauce so I really like that part. If you just like it hot, you'll love this.

3,mediocre cookies,"I don't usually review food, but since I've a fan of most things fig and/or Newtons, I figured I'd try them and share. Bleah.  These cookie things aren't really anything to write home...or Amazon...about.  The cookies, or 'thins', are about the size of an arrowroot biscuit, but less satisfying.  There are 3 in a serving size, packing 5 grams of fat and 140 calories.  For 5 grams of fat I either want something yummy enough to be worth it, or filling enough to make me believe I just consumed 5 grams of fat (some of which is saturated).  So this is not a snack to hold you over between meals, dieters.  I suppose the 8 grams of whole grains are attractive, but that just translates into 21 grams of carbs and only 2 grams of fiber.  So this is not really a healthy fiber treat either.  Now you might say that this isn't a health food, so I shouldn't be judging, but by calling them 'thins', Nabisco is looking to aim at the dieting market.<br /><br />I guess I was hoping for something more chewy than crunchy.  Unfortunately, the 'chewy' is the little bits of fig scattered throughout the cookie.  So little and chewy, in fact, that they get stuck in your teeth and have you uncomfortably nomming around like a dog with peanut butter on his tongue.  The fig and honey variety had a taste and consistency somewhat reminiscent of a graham cracker, but a little drier.<br /><br />So I'm not a fan of these, and I probably wouldn't buy them while roaming around the grocery store, but I'm giving them 3 stars on the strength of Newtons *other* fruit products, the Fig Newtons and the Newtons Fruit Crisps.  Both of those are chewy, delicious, and amazing.",Neutral,dont usually review food since ive fan thing fig andor newton figured id try share bleah cookie thing arent really anything write homeor amazonabout cooky thins size arrowroot biscuit less satisfying serving size packing gram fat calorie gram fat either want something yummy enough worth filling enough make believe consumed gram fat saturated snack hold meal dieter suppose gram whole grain attractive translates gram carbs gram fiber really healthy fiber treat either might say isnt health food shouldnt judging calling thins nabisco looking aim dieting marketi guess hoping something chewy crunchy unfortunately chewy little bit fig scattered throughout cookie little chewy fact get stuck teeth uncomfortably nomming around like dog peanut butter tongue fig honey variety taste consistency somewhat reminiscent graham cracker little drierso im fan probably wouldnt buy roaming around grocery store im giving star strength newton fruit product fig newton newton fruit crisp chewy delicious amazing

1,"Reality check: dry, dusty, and uninteresting---and expensive","My dogs are decidedly not ""new age"" or impressed by the fact that these dog treats ""are high in protein, naturally preserved with no wheat or corn, no artificial colors of [sic] flavor enhancers, and are free of added hormones, antibiotics and chemical additives.""<br /><br />Out of the bag, these treats seem decidedly overmanufactured, dry, dusty, and uninteresting. But I left it to my Australian Shepherds to decide on their own. During the first taste test, Kirwan, who will throw his head back like an alligator and eat anything tossed his way, crunched through the first one but was not interested in a second helping of these Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats. Pippin, who has a more discerning palette, moved his across the rug with his nose and subsequently abandoned it.<br /><br />This morning, I placed a treat on the floor for each dog, and Kirwan ate his without enthusiasm while Pippin again ignored his.<br /><br />Look, I love my dogs and I think Newman's Own is a fine company. But this product seems to me the result of overzealous people going to great lengths to make themselves feel good about what they are feeding their dogs. I cannot imagine the amount of farmland, energy, and resources expended to create these organic dog treats. We are really out of balance here with our priorities and perspectives.<br /><br />Perhaps some animal nutritionist blessed this recipe, the art department created the bucolic packaging, and the marketing folks carefully crafted the spin for this product, all to make us feel good about having these tucked away in our pantries, but at $4 a bag, this will be the only time this product appears in our house. Besides, my dogs, who actually like foul smelling foods and will gloriously roll in who knows what sorts of awful stuff they find, do not like these sorts of boutique fabrications.<br /><br />I really think a reality check is needed.

2,It does not taste like Chocolate Chip to me,"I thought these bars might be a good substitute for the Honey Nut Cherrios bar that I have for breakfast, I was wrong.<br /><br />Although they are both 40g bars the Cherrios bar is more filling.

The Whenever Bar has 15mg of Cholesterol, whereas the Cherrios bar has none.  The two bars are about even on Total Carbohydrates.<br /><br />To me this bar does not taste like Chocolate Chips - maybe that taste is overwhelmed by the heavy Coconut flavor.  If these were called Coconut bars, with a hint of Chocolate - maybe I would give them a higher rating - but, to me, the flavors are not as the product name would lead me to believe.<br /><br />I really was underwhelmed by this product, and unless you are a big Coconut fan, you probably want to buy something else.",Negative,thought bar might good substitute honey nut cherrios bar breakfast wrongalthough g bar cherrios bar filling even calorie whenever bar get fat whereas cherrios bar get fat whenever bar mg cholesterol whereas cherrios bar none two bar even total carbohydratesto bar taste like chocolate chip maybe taste overwhelmed heavy coconut flavor called coconut bar hint chocolate maybe would give higher rating flavor product name would lead believei really underwhelmed product unless big coconut fan probably want buy something else
4,Kyjen Dog Games Treat Wheel (Misc.),I have a 95lb pitbull/ mastiff mix that often loves his rope bone and his squeaker toy and thought it would be great to challenge him with some thinking toys.  I was a bit weary of this toy because my dog might chew up the plastic treat covers but found they are rather tough and that food incentive was greater than the chew incentive.  Overall it took about 10 minutes with the advice of the instructions and my pup was on his way to collecting treats from his new puzzle.  It takes him a few seconds now to pull the right cap off and start chowing on his goodies.  Another thing I would like to note is clean up is pretty easy.  I washed the tray and cups with hot water and soap and let dry next to the counter.<br /><br />This is a Social Writeup,Positive,lb pitbull mastiff mix often love rope bone squeaker toy thought would great challenge thinking toy bit weary toy dog might chew plastic treat cover found rather tough food incentive greater chew incentive overall took minute advice instruction pup way collecting treat new puzzle take second pull right cap start chowing goody another thing would like note clean pretty easy washed tray cup hot water soap let dry next counterthis social writeup

5,The spiciest chai,"I am a chai snob. I love chai, but have demanding standards about what I will and won't drink. Most lattes are too sweet and not spicy enough for me. This tea is far and away the most spicy, full of a rich flavors of cinnamon, ginger and cardamom, and yet, it has a very sweet note as well, probably because of the carob. The oolong tea leaves allow you to steep it long enough to get a strongly spiced flavor without the tea tannins going bitter. I don't even blend it into milk or add sugar -- I think a strongly brewed cup is perfect as it is. It's great to travel with if you have a strainer mug or brew it before you go, because even as it cools off it continues to taste spicy yet sweet. I much prefer it to Teavana's other chai blends, and over any other chai I've had really. While pricey, I find 2 oz. lasts about two weeks if you drink one large 12oz tumblr of tea a day, and longer if you're drinking an 8oz mug. The used leaves don't rebrew particularly well and take on a kind of ""metallic"" taste if you boil the leaves to try and improve the weak flavor of the rebrew, but this seems a small criticism of an otherwise excellent and robust tea.",Positive,chai snob love chai demanding standard wont drink latte sweet spicy enough tea far away spicy full rich flavor cinnamon ginger cardamom yet sweet note well probably carob oolong tea leaf allow steep long enough get strongly spiced flavor without tea tannin going bitter dont even blend milk add sugar think strongly brewed cup perfect great travel strainer mug brew go even cool continues taste spicy yet sweet much prefer teavanas chai blend chai ive really pricey find oz last two week drink one large oz tumblr tea day longer youre drinking oz mug used leaf dont rebrew particularly well take kind metallic taste boil leaf try improve weak flavor rebrew seems small criticism otherwise excellent robust tea

They are made in Switzerland, are vegan and gluten-free, and are perfect for the gluten-free chef's kitchen. I like the flavor much better than packaged stocks, and although of course making your own stock or broth from fresh veggies is better, it is really convenient to have these cubes on hand for adding a little flavor to recipes. I use them in Chinese dishes, for risotto, and of course for soups or stews. I like the fact that they are convenient to store, don't go bad (within reason), and don't have to be stored in the refrigerator. They also have a low-sodium variety which unfortunately does not seem to be offered by Amazon. Also, love that these are available for Prime/free shipping.

I could only get the small packages, so came online to see if I could find large packages.<br /><br />After having these, you won't have that greasy, stuffed-from-junk-food feeling.

5,Outstanding!,"I love the taste and the texture of these steel cut oats, but they can be somewhat of a labor of love to prepare.  It can take about 35 minutes to cook them from start to finish, with lots of stirring of the pot and keeping track of exactly how the heat is regulated on your stove.  I have made them the ""long"" way many times.  The taste is absolutely wonderful and the texture is quite pleasing.  I have also soaked the oats in water overnight and then cooked them the next morning which reduces the cooking time to about 10 minutes for me.  Still the same wonderful taste, but this method loses quite a lot of the whole grain sensation in the mouth.<br /><br />I was in the market for a rice cooker and while investigating them I noticed that some have a setting for porridge.  When I made my choice of the Panasonic SR-DE103 rice cooker it was partially because I wanted to use it to cook these oats.  The only drawback is that the rice cooker will only cook two servings at a time because the oats foam and bubble up so much during cooking.  Any more than two servings and they will be bubbling out of the steam vent of the cooker!  It also takes one hour to cook those two servings, but I can be off doing other things while the cooker takes care of the oats.  The oats cooked in the rice cooker have the same taste and texture as those cooked for the 35 minute method on the stove.<br /><br />This product is delightful.  I do add a tiny pinch of salt during the cooking time.  They are wonderful with either white sugar, brown sugar, honey, maple syrup, butter, or just completely unadorned.  And, which is very important, a serving of these steel cut oats stick with me and I don't find myself wanting to eat a second breakfast two hours later.  One serving lasts until lunch time and beyond (if I'm really busy).  Any leftovers also keep well in a bowl in the refrigerator and warm up nicely in the microwave.

2,Not much taste,I drank Twinings Darjeeling tea in Britain and loved it so I thought I was getting a good deal when I bought 300 bags at a good price from Amazon.  Now I wish I'd read the other reviews.  Apparently Twinings has a different blend for the US.  It has very little taste at all.  I'm giving it 2 stars because it's as good as anything one can find in the average US supermarket but that's not to say it's actually tasty.,Negative,drank twinings darjeeling tea britain loved thought getting good deal bought bag good price amazon wish id read review apparently twinings different blend u little taste im giving star good anything one find average u supermarket thats say actually tasty
5,well done brookly bean roastery,"Fugeddaboutit coffee has a nice rich taste that both my husband and I like, a tough task to hit.

5,Seems like an excellent shampoo.,"Not sure how much if any nourishment my hair is getting from this shampoo and I don't have any dandruff.

I like the way the bottle is made and the easy open dispensing.<br />So far I like the way my hair is coming out after shampooing and it does seem a little better than when I started. I have used most of the bottle and while I have seen a little improvement, there hasn't really been that much of an improvement.<br />I would say this shampoo would be worth trying as it does a nice job of cleaning, smells nice, bottle is easy to use and relatively inexpensive.<br />Keep in mind that they make so many shampoos because what one person likes, another will hate.",Positive,sure much nourishment hair getting shampoo dont dandruff nice job cleaning hair leaving tangle free somewhat conditioned using pantene prov shampoo compare favorably pantene like way bottle made easy open dispensingso far like way hair coming shampooing seem little better started used bottle seen little improvement hasnt really much improvementi would say shampoo would worth trying nice job cleaning smell nice bottle easy use relatively inexpensivekeep mind make many shampoo one person like another hate

5,Cattledogs love it!,"This is one great toy!  My busy, mouthy Cattledogs like it so much they will ask to play with it, sitting and staring at it on the shelf where it's stored.  When they first got the toy, it took them just a minute or two to get their mouths around the squirrel, but it took a couple days of play periods for them to figure out how to pull it out of the hole (it's a tight fit).  I let them play with the squeaky squirrel for a few minutes, then put it back in and say, ""Go find"".  They love it, and will throw the ""stump"" around and thrash it back and forth, extending the game.<br /><br />While the toy is very durable, it is suitable only for observed play, as the chewy rubber of the exterior could be ingested.  All the  Kyjen toys are made for interactive play, but it's a point that must be stressed: these are not chew toys.  The other thing to keep in mind is the amount of dog slobber all that ""Go find"" spreads around.

4,Light mint flavor that emulates a standard mojito well,"These new ""mocktails"" from Crystal Light are pretty awesome for sugar-free folk who are tired of the old standbys of raspberry ice, fruit punch, iced tea with peach, and so on.  Instead of going for another standard fruit flavor they mimic a variety of mostly fluffy drinks, and they all manage to taste remarkably like the hard drink they are modeled after.<br /><br />The mojito version has a nice trace of mint, although its flavor is much more mild and light than the appletini edition, which is probably the best of the bunch. Using more or less water when mixing can easily change the flavor if you want it a little stronger. Much like with the appletini, the mojito Crystal Light works great as a mixer for alcohol if you want to spice it up and make it more like the real thing.<br /><br />This is definitely recommended if you regularly enjoy Crystal Light and want to try something different from the standard array of flavors.",Positive,new mocktails crystal light pretty awesome sugarfree folk tired old standby raspberry ice fruit punch iced tea peach instead going another standard fruit flavor mimic variety mostly fluffy drink manage taste remarkably like hard drink modeled afterthe mojito version nice trace mint although flavor much mild light appletini edition probably best bunch using less water mixing easily change flavor want little stronger much like appletini mojito crystal light work great mixer alcohol want spice make like real thingthis definitely recommended regularly enjoy crystal light want try something different standard array flavor
4,Tasty fatty corny,These chips have a great taste and if you keep it in the front of your mind you can taste the green olives. I don't know how much olive gets into the chips but just knowing some was in them made them taste fattier to me. (Each serving is 11% of your recommended daily fat.)

1,***MADE IN CHINA***,The disturbing thing is that they are made in China.  Nowhere on the product description does it state that fact.

5,""" A MIRACLE SUPPLEMENT!!""","I'm a 32 year old man. Construction Electrician. I'm wound REALLY tight. I was diagnosed with abnormally high blood pressure for my age about a year ago. On top of this I also suffer from extreme anxiety, nervousness, sleep issues, muscle aches, etc. After many tests, blood pressure medication and Zoloft, nothing really seemed to work. About a month ago I was getting a colonic and my hydrotherapist said that I was more than likely magnesium deficient. 2 days later I saw my urologist who diagnosed me (after a 24 hour urine test) with exactly that, magnesium deficiency. I went down to the local health food store and the clerk recommended that I try ""Natural Calm""; As usual, I was skeptical (especially with the $20 price tag on an 8 oz. bottle). Needless to say, I was willing to give anything a shot.<br /><br />I must say...this is a MIRACLE SUPPLEMENT!!! I take it 2 times a day (1-1/2 tsp. in the morning and 1-1/2 tsp. in the evening). This stuff gives me energy when I need it, all the while calming me down and 100% eliminating my nervousness and anxiety. I'm waking up in a snap and falling asleep even quicker (I stopped taking sleep aids). I have a great night of sleep and notice my body is requiring less sleep to achieve the same results. As for the body and muscle aches...those, too, have disappeared. I don't have to swallow Alieve everyday anymore to alleviate these symptoms because ""Natural Calm"" does the job.<br /><br />I've been taking ""Natural Calm"" for about 2-1/2 weeks now and am truly grateful that I stumbled upon this product. People at work, as well as my girlfriend, son, and parents have all noticed a change in me. Best of all, the change I feel within myself is amazing. All the little problems my M.D. couldn't iron out were immediately dealt with upon my first dose of this stuff.<br /><br />As for negatives to ""Natural Calm""...I see none. Many people have complained about the taste, but to me the stuff tastes fine; almost similar to Sprite, but with a hint of a sour citrus kick.<br /><br />All in all 5+ stars. ""Natural Calm"" will be a part of my daily regime from this day forward. If you truly have a magnesium deficiency, look no further...this is the answer.",Positive,im year old man construction electrician im wound really tight diagnosed abnormally high blood pressure age year ago top also suffer extreme anxiety nervousness sleep issue muscle ache etc many test blood pressure medication zoloft nothing really seemed work month ago getting colonic hydrotherapist said likely magnesium deficient day later saw urologist diagnosed hour urine test exactly magnesium deficiency went local health food store clerk recommended try natural calm usual skeptical especially price tag oz bottle needless say willing give anything shoti must saythis miracle supplement take time day tsp morning tsp evening stuff give energy need calming eliminating nervousness anxiety im waking snap falling asleep even quicker stopped taking sleep aid great night sleep notice body requiring less sleep achieve result body muscle achesthose disappeared dont swallow alieve everyday anymore alleviate symptom natural calm jobive taking natural calm week truly grateful stumbled upon product people work well girlfriend son parent noticed change best change feel within amazing little problem md couldnt iron immediately dealt upon first dose stuffas negative natural calmi see none many people complained taste stuff taste fine almost similar sprite hint sour citrus kickall star natural calm part daily regime day forward truly magnesium deficiency look furtherthis answer

My favorite was the double chocolate brownie, and I am really not a choco-holic! They just tasted good without having to be stale first. The chips inside gave it a crispier ""taste.""

3,Dogs Luv These but they Crumble into Nothing!,I bought these due to the wonderful reviews. My 3 rating is based on my dogs who seem to love these little patties/treats. But upon receiving the bag the majority of these soft cookie size patties had crumbled into nothing but tasty dust on the bottom of the bag. No handing out this as a treat or as a food patty you would have to pour the crumbs into a bowl. The packaging or shipping would need to change to keep these in their original round cookie/patty shape. Due to the condition of these patties I would not order these again (sorry doggies). When you have a few dogs like I do you need them in the correct measured size so you know each dog gets the same/right amount.

5,AWESOME!  But darn...,"Warning these are highly addictive chips!  I love the sea salt and the salsa flavors - best gluten free taste and texture I've ever put in my mouth.  I can easily clean out most of a bag in one sitting.  Very healthy snack!  Cons:  there's an awful lot of air in that bag... And they are often broken up a lot, so you have to learn to dip your dip with a spoon, then stick a bunch of broken chips to that.  So delicious, I'm willing to do that.  Here's the other bummer.... If you're addicted, you want to buy in bulk with a goal to save money.  I was shocked at the price here on amazon, in bulk.  $46 for 12 bags (5.5 oz) plus shipping at $10+.... That's $57 total which comes out to $4.73 ish per bag (5.5 oz).  I can get them at a Publix grocery store for $2.89 a bag (5.5 oz) -- that's $1.89 cheaper.

5,As good as any packaged pasta I've had,"Love this product. It has become my #1 pasta because it's completely wheat free, and corn has a better glycemic index than wheat. Also love the fact that it's made with non-GMO corn. This is also one of the few pastas whose package directions give accurate cooking time - most pastas tell you to cook for way too long, but this is not overdone at all when you took according to directions - I usually have to cook it a minute longer, and I like my pasta almost hard. I find it more robust and wholesome than semolina or durham pasta and better texture than brown rice pasta, which often falls apart.  This keeps its shape and has that nice springy al dente feel to it.  It's great with a good bottled spaghetti sauce, fresh grated reggiano on top and some garlicky sauteed spinach mixed in - fast & easy & yummy when I don't want to cook a more complex meal.

4,Great Substitute for Freebirds Chicken Apple Wedges When You Can't Find Them.,"Our dogs love the Freebird chicken apple wedges, but the economic two-pound bag is too hard to find since I purchased them at here-today-gone-tomorrow Costco.  The small bags are a bit pricey BUT they're not made in China.  My brother always insisted that we only buy dog food made in the USA when we had our three labs.  Now I have a beagle and a blue heeler with my guy, and we are always trying to treat them for good behavior.  I found and buy these at Petco.  The bag has more content than the usual packs of Freebirds, and they like them as well, but I didn't realize until reading other reviewer comments where they came from.  Filled with condroitin and glucosamine for the mature dog with hip problems (the blue heeler), I thought I'd give them a try.  Though I don't see any distinct improvement in our 12 year-old Sydney's hips, I don't see anything detrimental either.  They come to the cupboard after coming in from outside or a bath just as before and gobble them down like a kid with candy.  The China factor makes me a little uneasy, especially at that price, but I see no ill effects thus far.  I asked my vet today what she thought, and she said that they're probably fine as long as they're not recalled, but the laws in China are less strict about what they put in their products.  It makes me wonder if I want to risk my dogs being a recall factor if that should happen, so use your own judgement.  All I know is that my own canines love them, and others here seem to have no problem with them either.",Positive,dog love freebird chicken apple wedge economic twopound bag hard find since purchased heretodaygonetomorrow costco small bag bit pricey theyre made china brother always insisted buy dog food made usa three lab beagle blue heeler guy always trying treat good behavior found buy petco bag content usual pack freebirds like well didnt realize reading reviewer comment came filled condroitin glucosamine mature dog hip problem blue heeler thought id give try though dont see distinct improvement yearold sydney hip dont see anything detrimental either come cupboard coming outside bath gobble like kid candy china factor make little uneasy especially price see ill effect thus far asked vet today thought said theyre probably fine long theyre recalled law china less strict put product make wonder want risk dog recall factor happen use judgement know canine love others seem problem either

5,mmmmm I love this stuff!,"I got this for my husband who uses one of the old bar soaps known for leaving a ""sticky soap film"" behind.  He is a man of habit though and wouldn't use it even when I reminded him of the great commercial they had for the super bowl.  So, I hid his soap and left him with either this or puppy shampoo for his morning bath.  That did the trick! Not only that but this stuff has a really nice, subtle masculine scent.  mmmmmmmmm, I LIKE this stuff!  He smells sexy but not until you get really, really close, so I don't have to worry about the girls at work ""sniffing after him"".<br /><br />In the interest of writing a good review I did some additional research and used it on myself in the shower:  This product lathers nicely, and rinses very clean.  It does a good job of washing off sweat, dirt, grease, etc. without having to reapply.  After using it, I did not have dry or itchy skin and I felt clean and refreshed.  The scent was faint and kinda woodsy, it reminded me of sandlewood but very subtle.  While this product is for men, I would use it again. As for my husband, I hope he keeps using this -- did I mention? -- mmmm I LOVE the smell of this on him.",Positive,got husband us one old bar soap known leaving sticky soap film behind man habit though wouldnt use even reminded great commercial super bowl hid soap left either puppy shampoo morning bath trick stuff really nice subtle masculine scent mmmmmmmmm like stuff smell sexy get really really close dont worry girl work sniffing himin interest writing good review additional research used shower product lather nicely rinse clean good job washing sweat dirt grease etc without reapply using dry itchy skin felt clean refreshed scent faint kinda woodsy reminded sandlewood subtle product men would use husband hope keep using mention mmmm love smell

They don't have any significant fiber or other nutrients, but they're better on calories than most snacks.<br /><br />I liked how classy they looked with the chocolate drizzled over the caramel corn. It made them seem more like candy than popcorn. It's a good thing they are portioned in single serve bags, or it would be easy to eat too much!<br /><br />The only drawback is that there are only 6 packages in a box and they might be a little pricey for a snack.

5,rich and smooth coffee,"Marley Coffee in individual cup pods is something new for me. I have a DeLonge espresso maker with the feature to use it with coffee pods. So my review is based on using this device to make the Marley coffee. I made very large cups of coffee and tried them with cream and sweetener (stevia or agave)and also just black. I generally drink coffee with half and half with or without a sweetener. Marley coffee could be compared to a strong brew of coffee house coffee such as Caribou but without the bitter taste or the hollow taste I find in many of the coffee house brews. The Marley coffee is very strong with that tingling sensation in the mouth but does not have the bitter taste. It is very rich and smooth. This is one of the few coffees that I would likely drink black because it lacks the bitterness but has a strong flavor. It is very likely the best coffee I have ever tasted. It is not cheap. At about 75 cents a cup, it is for me not an option to drink several each day. I strongly and smoothly recommend this product.",Positive,marley coffee individual cup pod something new delonge espresso maker feature use coffee pod review based using device make marley coffee made large cup coffee tried cream sweetener stevia agaveand also black generally drink coffee half half without sweetener marley coffee could compared strong brew coffee house coffee caribou without bitter taste hollow taste find many coffee house brew marley coffee strong tingling sensation mouth bitter taste rich smooth one coffee would likely drink black lack bitterness strong flavor likely best coffee ever tasted cheap cent cup option drink several day strongly smoothly recommend product

2,**********  READ THIS FIRST PLEASE ************,"First off, the initial arrival:  It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat!  Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary.  Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective;<br />1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces<br />2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several.<br />3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging.<br />In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags.  Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's.  Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way.  But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Amazon charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping).  If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.  An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats",Negative,first initial arrival came bigger box since thing ordered well opened yellow bag set neatly ready eat packaging box bag used necessary review value going put perspective average size bag ounce larger size bag range ounce depending one make several bag ounce go ounce certain packagingin theory could go buy bunch ounce package equal total ounce bag youd buy bag bag would cheaper go bag however cost item little disappointing expected little bag aside portion probably height bag air hoping mm overall give purchase c value cheaper buy way always beware pricing example another seller amazon charge bag pay shipping wanted buy using amazon prime like could get regular mm peanut less may worth saving okay value end day cheaper buying individually beat

4,Strong Coffee Taste,"This coffee drink has a much stronger coffee taste than most -- and I like that.  I don't drink a lot of coffee products, but when I do I want something that is definitely coffee and not a confusing combination of flavors and sweeteners.  In addition to the strong coffee taste, there is a hint of bitterness but it's not unpleasant.  This is not a beverage I would drink daily -- I think it would lose some of its excitement and get a bit boring -- but it's nice to have a few cans in the refrigerator.  By the way, I tried heating a serving... don't bother, this drink is absolutely at its best served well chilled.",Positive,coffee drink much stronger coffee taste like dont drink lot coffee product want something definitely coffee confusing combination flavor sweetener addition strong coffee taste hint bitterness unpleasant beverage would drink daily think would lose excitement get bit boring nice can refrigerator way tried heating serving dont bother drink absolutely best served well chilled
5,Wonderful Bread!,"I am new to a gluten free diet and have to say that I have not been all that thrilled with GF breads.  They either smell bad, taste terrible or don't cook completely in my Bread Machine leaving them doughy in the middle.  This product however made me go WOW in every way!  I love it!!  It cooks though, it is soft and moist, has a nice texture and does not smell strange as other gf recipes have.  If you try it and like it you can also save on the cost by purchasing the 4 pound bag.  To make bread from bulk per a phone call with Pamela's - it is 2 1/4t yeast and 3 1/2c bread mix then follow the instructions on the individual bag: in a 2 cup liquid measuring cup, measure 1/4c oil, 2 eggs, fill with warm water to 2 cups liquid, plus add 2T additional water (I omit the last 2T of water personally).

5,This stuff is awesome,"Seriously, it is so good!  Tea snobs that insist on using a decanter make me laugh.  ""Who uses tea bags?"", they say.  If you're feeling hip, you could go down to your local shopping mall, go inside a Teavana store, and spend over $100 bucks on a fancy teapot.  Or, you could just buy a stainless-steel electric water heater for $10 and this tea for under $20.  I drink at least 2 cups of the stuff at work.

It's great with a banana, ice, bit of soy milk, 2 tablespoons of the powder and agave...you can switch it up by adding cocoa or peanut butter to it too. With both of those add-ins, the hemp isn't really noticeable by taste (only with the color of the drink)...but after a while making it like that, I'm pretty used to the taste and can have it without the add in ingredients too.<br /><br />It's a great source of protein for people who don't want whey or, like me, don't want to overuse soy as a protein source.<br /><br />They have organic available in this product, but the regular one is made with out pesticides and isn't GMO...<br /><br />I have yet to try it in other things like sprinkled on salads (it has a gritty/nutty taste) or baked in anything...",Positive,love product manitoba harvest used instead whey blender drink great banana ice bit soy milk tablespoon powder agaveyou switch adding cocoa peanut butter addins hemp isnt really noticeable taste color drinkbut making like im pretty used taste without add ingredient tooits great source protein people dont want whey like dont want overuse soy protein sourcethey organic available product regular one made pesticide isnt gmoi yet try thing like sprinkled salad grittynutty taste baked anything

5,Perhaps the coolest soft drink EVER!,"Ramune has to be one of the coolest and most unique soft drinks that I have ever seen. My kids had been dying to try this stuff ever since they had come across it on J-Box, the popular Japanese import webshop. Ramune is incredibly popular in it's native Japan, and now it looks like the fun is beginning to spread here in the States.<br /><br />To open a bottle of Ramune, you have to remove the top, pop out this little plastic plunger from it's casing, and then use the plunger to pop out a marble that seals the neck of the bottle. The neck of the bottle has two indentions that will hold the marble when you tip the bottle back to drink from it, keeping the neck of the bottle clear. Hold the bottle the wrong way, and the marble will clog things up. You can avoid carbonated overflow when opening by pressing gently on the plunger until it depresses the marble; knock it down with force and you're sure to get a fountain of spray.<br /><br />The original flavor reviewed here tastes a lot like Sprite, but Ramune also comes in several other flavors. It uses high fructose corn syrup and/or cane sugar as a sweetener (It lists both on the label, which usually means that it uses whatever is cheapest on the world market at the time of bottling. Listing both also means that they don't have to change their labeling every time they change sweetener.)<br /><br />This is a way fun product that kids (and most adults) will have a blast with. It's a smaller portion (8 ounces) than what we're used to here in the US, but that actually works out for us as we're trying to limit the amount of soda that our kids consume. Ramune works great as an occasional soda treat and the fun factor alone keeps us coming back for more.<br /><br />Ramune six-packs are easy to find at just about any Asian market at around $7 or $8. If you have to order online, try some of the various Asian food sites out there as the price here is just too high to justify unless you have absolutely no other option.<br /><br />Also, for the safety conscious, I can attest that these drinks are very safe. We've never had a problem with the marble, and I can't find any reports on the internet that would indicate any safety concerns with this drink. It's not a choking hazard, in other words. Ramune means 'carbonated' in Japanese, and I can highly recommend this wonderful and very different drink.",Positive,ramune one coolest unique soft drink ever seen kid dying try stuff ever since come across jbox popular japanese import webshop ramune incredibly popular native japan look like fun beginning spread statesto open bottle ramune remove top pop little plastic plunger casing use plunger pop marble seal neck bottle neck bottle two indention hold marble tip bottle back drink keeping neck bottle clear hold bottle wrong way marble clog thing avoid carbonated overflow opening pressing gently plunger depresses marble knock force youre sure get fountain spraythe original flavor reviewed taste lot like sprite ramune also come several flavor us high fructose corn syrup andor cane sugar sweetener list label usually mean us whatever cheapest world market time bottling listing also mean dont change labeling every time change sweetenerthis way fun product kid adult blast smaller portion ounce used u actually work u trying limit amount soda kid consume ramune work great occasional soda treat fun factor alone keep u coming back moreramune sixpack easy find asian market around order online try various asian food site price high justify unless absolutely optionalso safety conscious attest drink safe weve never problem marble cant find report internet would indicate safety concern drink choking hazard word ramune mean carbonated japanese highly recommend wonderful different drink
1,Untouched by disappointed cats,"Everyone gave these treats rave reviews, so I thought I would give them a try. I have two cats, one who is very picky and one who will eat just about anything I give her, even other breath fresheners that the other cat doesn't care for. I assumed that at least one would take the bait. Both cats completely snubbed these things. Sniffed at and walked away cold. I broke one in half in case the inside might reveal more aroma. Nothing.

1,Disappointing!!!,"I have been looking for a good sweetner for a long, long time. Sugar is out, and after reading about all the research on the artificial substitutes, I was almost physically sick. Those little blue, pink and yellow packets we've been pouring into our drinks are highly toxic!!! It boils down to the fact that these products are made from wood alcohol. In other words, formaldehyde!<br />It causes a myriad of health problems, and could be a pre-cursor to alzheimers, according to medical lab researchers. Many people experience loss of memory, slow, fuzzy thinking, or fogginess. There are so many other troubling symptoms that I cannot even list them all.<br />This is why I tried ""Just Like Sugar"". I put one packet in my tea and couldn't tell any difference. I put 2 more in, and still couldn't tell it was sweet at all. I had the feeling I was going to stand there all day and pour it in and still nothing would change. I am stuck with 3 boxes now, but never fear I DID find something better called ""TRUVIA"". I found it at the grocery store and am very happy with it. It has the natural sweetner Stevia in it and is healthy for you.

5,Sweet!,"Eaten by themselves, Yacon slices are pretty bland. The taste and texture is somewhat akin to dried apples.<br /><br />I mostly use Yacon in the blender, as a raw chocolate smoothie sweetener, supplementing the goji berries, cacao nibs and some frozen fruit, like blueberries, and maybe some kale. It makes a sweet counterpoint to the bitter stuff like the chocolate and the veggies. Yum.<br /><br />Supposedly, there are also a lot of health benefits to Yacon, and is a diabetic-friendly sweetener. And since it bypasses the GI tract and instead gets processed in the colon, Yacon helps balance the gut flora and aids in digestion.",Positive,eaten yacon slice pretty bland taste texture somewhat akin dried applesi mostly use yacon blender raw chocolate smoothie sweetener supplementing goji berry cacao nib frozen fruit like blueberry maybe kale make sweet counterpoint bitter stuff like chocolate veggie yumsupposedly also lot health benefit yacon diabeticfriendly sweetener since bypass gi tract instead get processed colon yacon help balance gut flora aid digestion
4,Effective and concentrated,"I picked the Clear Men Scalp Therapy 2 in 1 Anti-Dandruff Shampoo and Conditioner, because I usually get a mild case of Dandruff once in a while, and my hair is dry and curly, so a shampoo with conditioner is always my first choice. In this case the herbs, Ginseng, Tea Tree & Mint, which are part of the ingredients of the CMST2in1AS, influenced my preference too. It's very concentrated; a little bit will do a nice lather and it does what it promises, it cleans hair and scalp leaving a cool refreshing feeling with easy to comb hair. And in my personal situation, without dryness. The smell is really nice too.<br /><br />This is a great shampoo to use especially during the summer when one might wash hair more than once a day, for example, during the morning and after going to the beach. In my case, I don't style my hair during the summer because of the heat and the humidity, so simply washing it and towel dry work out pretty well for me.",Positive,picked clear men scalp therapy antidandruff shampoo conditioner usually get mild case dandruff hair dry curly shampoo conditioner always first choice case herb ginseng tea tree mint part ingredient cmstinas influenced preference concentrated little bit nice lather promise clean hair scalp leaving cool refreshing feeling easy comb hair personal situation without dryness smell really nice toothis great shampoo use especially summer one might wash hair day example morning going beach case dont style hair summer heat humidity simply washing towel dry work pretty well

That said though, they are an excellent snack and a much healthier alternative to potato chips or corn chips.<br /><br />The main thing that surprised me about these chips is how good they taste.  To me, they taste just as good, and are just as fulfilling, as the other salty crunchy snacks that I tend to munch on in the evenings.

3,Not that bad,"I am not a fan of artificial sweeteners, but this product really isn't that bad. There really isn't an after taste and not as intense as I thought it would have been as some of the reviews have made it out to be. The flavor is not amazing, but not bad either. I was expecting a little more zing. All in all, I paid 9.99 for 24 cups and I am not disappointed. Yes the ""natural"" and ""real"" product is better (I have tried both), but if I see this product at that good of a price again, I will definitely buy it. 3 out of 5 stars for value and taste (yes it's still enjoyable).",Neutral,fan artificial sweetener product really isnt bad really isnt taste intense thought would review made flavor amazing bad either expecting little zing paid cup disappointed yes natural real product better tried see product good price definitely buy star value taste yes still enjoyable

I would say something like ""Amazon saves the day again"" as this 5 pound bag cost a little more than half a pound costs in local stores, but 5 pounds is a lot of candy!  it is nice if you have self control ;) and can keep them in good condition.

They rae however very very close to the original.  These are rasberry and blackberry flavor.  Mu husband thinks the  2 flavors are indistinguishable, my son doesn't like the blackberry (which are my favorite).  No they do not taste like fresh fruit, but, that said they are much closer then the artificial flavors found in many fruit candies.  As candy goes, this is one of the better ones nutritionally, made with real sugar and fruit juices and containing no fat.  *most* of the ingrdients are natural; overall better than most in that regard and one I do not worry about giving my kids....except for the quantity ;)  If you have not ordered these before, 5 lbs is a lot of candy.

It may be decaffeinated, but who knows, its flavor is so weak and flacid that one hardly cares.<br />I feel ripped off after buying this and you will too.  Do yourself a favor and avoid it.

3,Buggy Garden!,"I got this garden for Christmas.  My first round of mixed herbs went pretty well.  However, you need to follow the directions for harvesting.  Some of my plants did not look so good after awhile.  Also, something was eating my basil.  Everyday I would find little bite marks on it.  I did get some nice herbs and enjoyed cooking with them at the beginning.  My garden never really looked like the picture.  I think I harvested a little early and took to much off at first. I decided to try again.<br /><br />My next herb kit is in there right now.  Not doing so well.  Little nats or white flys are everywhere.  They must have come with the plants.

5,Great rice!,"I love this rice. It's a great compromise between brown and white rice. It cooks in about the same time as white and has a similar flavor and consistency once cooked, but has twice the fiber. It's not as much as brown rice, of course, but doesn't take as long to cook.

So I rather like the cheekiness of referring to Buffalo wings in this product!<br /><br />And these are tasty indeed.

I've only made cupcakes with it, but they come out soft and moist every time. There's no weird gluten-free taste at all with the results of this mix - kiss cardboardy desserts goodbye!

Only after several weeks of this combination have I finally been able to stop supplementing with formula!!  I don't know which products are doing the trick, or if they truly are each contributing, but I wouldn't stop taking a single one and risk losing my supply.  For the record, though, I started fenugreek first and noticed an increase, though it wasn't until I had this whole combination that my supply has become sufficient.

When the cans were opened, the contents had separated into solid and liquid.  We tried to mix it together again, but the cat refused it.  I email the company and sent a picture along and they said it had been subjected to extreme heat and had cooked in the can.  It wasn't hot locally, so I believe it happened while in Amazon's hands.  Additionally, Amazon has been less then helpful in processing the return.<br /><br />So, buy the food for your cat if it likes it, but just not from Amazon.  Get it from a company that handles food products regularly; they probably know a lot more about keeping products edible.",Negative,lousy packagingstorage food wonderful cat love amazon really made mess order can opened content separated solid liquid tried mix together cat refused email company sent picture along said subjected extreme heat cooked wasnt hot locally believe happened amazon hand additionally amazon less helpful processing returnso buy food cat like amazon get company handle food product regularly probably know lot keeping product edible

3,some good results some bad...,"I bought the 12 bottle variety to try out.  I just recently started using a hot air popper so wanted to see what varieties worked well.<br /><br />First off.  The baby white and baby yellow kernels are just too light for use in a hot air popper.  We did pop them at work using a traditional popper and they were fine.<br /><br />The are two varieties that stood out as my favorites for my hot air popper.  The first is the Wisconsin White Birch, which popped up big, fluffy and close to zero unpopped or blow out kernels.  The second is Savannah Gold, it popped up big, nice volume and again almost zero unpopped or blow out kernels.<br /><br />Two varieties that are close seconds as favorites are: Autumn Blaze Blend (small, crisp, no unpopped kernels but quite a few blow outs) and High Mountain Midnight (some no pops, good volume).<br /><br />There was only one variety that I would not ever use again.  The Black Hills had about 4 times the quantity of unpopped kernels as any of the other types, the kernels popped up very small, it was extremely hully and some kernels burnt in the hot air popper.<br /><br />Orchard Blossom, Red River Valley and Harvest Blend types all popped fine in my hot air popper with only a few unpopped kernels.

5,great product and keeps the body happy,"I use this product everyday and I have continued to buy it since I discovered it.  I put it with rice milk, or with fruit in a smoothie, etc.  If you just put it in water and drink it, then yes it is grainy.  I don't do that and don't recommend such.  It really helps to balance the blood sugar and keep the body happy.  It is satisfying in keeping the appetite down.  It keeps my lower tract running well.  It is high protein and has carb balance as well.  Be sure to add it with something to avoid the gritty taste.  It wasn't designed to be drank with just water though a person could do it.  I've tried the more expensive Nutiva blends that have flavors added and they are great.  Nutiva does a good job in producing healthy products.  This particular hemp protein powder is effective and it is the cheapest among the hemp protein lines so I just add my own fruit, maca, etc.  If you want to stay economical and add your own blend to it then you have a program that works great.  If you want a sweeter taste then buy the other types of Nutiva hemp as they have several great flavors.

1,They Secretly Switched The Coffee At My Favorite Restaurant With This Garbage,"One of the favorite places that I frequent when we can afford a nice meal is the The Pungent Moon in Trenton. Besides their steaks and macadamia-encrusted tilapia, one of the best things about the place is the heavenly coffee they serve with their fine desserts. The coffee is actually one of the main reasons we go.<br /><br />But one night we were there enjoying a meal and we asked for coffee with dessert and we got served this rancid stuff. I almost spit out my first sip all over the table and had to run to the bathroom because I was gagging. I made it back to the table (barely) and asked the waiter what in the wide world of sports happened to the coffee.<br /><br />He said that they were filming a television commercial for Folger's and they were secretly replacing their coffee with Folger's to film people's reactions to the coffee switch. Needless to say I didn't get to be in the commercial. It wouldn't have been very savvy marketing for Folger's to show some guy gagging and making a beeline for the bathroom after tasting their coffee.<br /><br />I don't know where they got those people in the commercials to rave about the coffee because there wasn't anyone in the restaurant doing it. Most people didn't have my reaction but a lot of them were making faces like they'd just smelled a dead octopus. It was a dirty trick. You'd think Folger's would have bagged this idea for a commercial seeing people's reactions but I guess they found some schmo to say he liked it.

Yes its expensive but its cheaper then having to throw out food cause she wont eat it & shes not that big so she eats only 2 patties a day max. If you have a small picky eater this is GREAT & seems to be very healthy. If you have a large dog this might be a healthy thing to add to their dryfood (not to mention a nice way to spice up their food).

4,nice twist on the original,"I love plain cheerios but sometimes a little cheerio diversity is called for.  The banana nut flavor is not overly sweet and there is a distinctive banana taste, almost a slightly burnt banana taste.  I love pairing a bowl of these cheerios with so delicious coconut milk and sliced banana pieces.  The combination of the three easily keep me satiated from breakfast until lunch.  I occasionally mix this banana nut flavor with chocolate cheerios for an even sweeter, exceptional treat.<br /><br />While I do not find the banana nut flavor to be overly sweet, one should not overlook that sugar is the second ingredient for this food and, the sugar content is relatively high -- especially for frequent use by children.  Four grams of sugar is equivalent to 1 teaspoon of sugar. So you have about 2 and 1/4 teaspoons in a single 3/4 cup serving of banana nut cheerios. With everything else your kids consume during the day, (chocolate milk? orange juice? sandwich with jam?), the sugar in this cereal may be high for frequent consumption. Kids usually need 1200 to 1700 calories a day. While there is no prescribed amount of sugar for a kid during the day, I have read that the calories from added sugar should be limited to 10% which, on the low end, would translate to 7 teaspoons of sugar and 11 teaspoons on the high end. If you child is getting 2 and 1/4 teaspoons with this cereal, your child has consumed a fair amount of sugar for the morning.<br /><br />When paired with fresh bananas, this cereal can be filling but if limiting sugar for your kids (or your own meals), you might want to use sparingly.",Positive,love plain cheerio sometimes little cheerio diversity called banana nut flavor overly sweet distinctive banana taste almost slightly burnt banana taste love pairing bowl cheerio delicious coconut milk sliced banana piece combination three easily keep satiated breakfast lunch occasionally mix banana nut flavor chocolate cheerio even sweeter exceptional treatwhile find banana nut flavor overly sweet one overlook sugar second ingredient food sugar content relatively high especially frequent use child four gram sugar equivalent teaspoon sugar teaspoon single cup serving banana nut cheerio everything else kid consume day chocolate milk orange juice sandwich jam sugar cereal may high frequent consumption kid usually need calorie day prescribed amount sugar kid day read calorie added sugar limited low end would translate teaspoon sugar teaspoon high end child getting teaspoon cereal child consumed fair amount sugar morningwhen paired fresh banana cereal filling limiting sugar kid meal might want use sparingly
5,Wonderful Product without the Sugar and extra calories!,"Purchased this because I fell in love with the regular (yellow bottle) version of this and was buying it in a convenient store at $3/bottle.  This version tastes almost the same with no noticeable ""sweetener"" flavor and saves many calories (due to the lack of sugar, but NOT sugar-free).  You may find cheaper in the store (locally was $5.99/4pack while amazon is $22.71/12pack), but the convenience cannot be beat.  And my last purchase (March 18, 2012) was good until Jan 2013.",Positive,purchased fell love regular yellow bottle version buying convenient store bottle version taste almost noticeable sweetener flavor save many calorie due lack sugar sugarfree may find cheaper store locally pack amazon pack convenience beat last purchase march good jan

4,Excellent Protein Snack,"I liked the Planter's snack bars.  Basically it is a larger and higher calorie version of a regular granola bar with the added joy of having fat planter's peanuts on top.<br /><br />As other have said, it is not a diet bar and is probably a bit messier than your average granola bar which are always nice to have in the car.  However it is tasty and sweet and depending on what you are looking for in a granola bar (did I just type that) this should satisfy both your sweet and salty cravings.",Positive,liked planter snack bar basically larger higher calorie version regular granola bar added joy fat planter peanut topas said diet bar probably bit messier average granola bar always nice car however tasty sweet depending looking granola bar type satisfy sweet salty craving
5,My dogs love these.,"My dogs loved these treats.  They are bigger than what I had originally expected.  I thought they were a tiny strips of duck meat wrapped around a sweet potato fry, which in a sense they are.  They are actually a whole breast or at least half of one wrapped around a sweet potato fry.  Much more meat than I expected.  These take my dogs a few minutes to gobble up instead of just a few seconds with other treats.<br /><br />I like the fact that the ingredients only state duck meat and sweet potato, no harsh preservatives you tend to find in most treats, especially ones that come from China.<br /><br />The cost compared to the amount you get is well worth the price I paid.  My dogs go through about 2 of these each a day which a bag will last me about a week or so.  I definitely plan on buying more of these, its to bad they don't have the automatic delivery for these as they do for coffee because I would definitely sign up.<br /><br />I highly recommend these treats.",Positive,dog loved treat bigger originally expected thought tiny strip duck meat wrapped around sweet potato fry sense actually whole breast least half one wrapped around sweet potato fry much meat expected take dog minute gobble instead second treatsi like fact ingredient state duck meat sweet potato harsh preservative tend find treat especially one come chinathe cost compared amount get well worth price paid dog go day bag last week definitely plan buying bad dont automatic delivery coffee would definitely sign upi highly recommend treat
5,"Very concentrated, but good!","I'm not nearly as picky about the variety of flavors so I'm not unhappy about the duplications.<br /><br />When I first bought them, I started with Root Beer, Watermelon, orange oil and cotton candy.  I used too much and wasn't pleased with the flavor results.<br /><br />What I've learned since:  Use a dropper to measure the amount of flavoring!  Use orange oil with only SIX DROPS PER LITRE. It was my error in the beginning that made the products seem bad.  Root Beer in particular is very bitter if you use too much.<br /><br />I purchased these to use with my Soda Stream soda maker and Sweat Leaf Stevia sweetener.  The vials seem small, but they make quite a bit when you use them sparingly.  I now keep a dropper handy for measuring.<br /><br />I'm simply having a ball choosing what flavor of soda I am drinking for the day.",Positive,im nearly picky variety flavor im unhappy duplicationswhen first bought started root beer watermelon orange oil cotton candy used much wasnt pleased flavor resultswhat ive learned since use dropper measure amount flavoring use orange oil six drop per litre error beginning made product seem bad root beer particular bitter use muchi purchased use soda stream soda maker sweat leaf stevia sweetener vial seem small make quite bit use sparingly keep dropper handy measuringim simply ball choosing flavor soda drinking day

5,Not Christmas without these Cookies!,"I look forward to these cake-like ginger spice cookies at the start of every Christmas season. As to their authenticity, I lived near Munich (M&uuml;nchen) in Germany when a child over 35 years ago, and they are the exact same cookies we ate back then. They are the perfect mixture of sweet and spice; and lightly crunchy on the outside, spongy soft inside. No other brand or variation will suffice for me, not even the fully chocolate-coated version which -- while still very good -- throws off the delicate balance of flavors. A literal translation of ""lebkuchen"" is ""life cakes"", and once you've tried these confections you may understand why.<br /><br />They are hard to find in local stores. I've had reasonable luck finding them at Cost Plus World Market (usually ranging six to eight bucks per package), although they fly off the shelves fairly quickly with almost no chance of a reorder before Christmas.",Positive,look forward cakelike ginger spice cooky start every christmas season authenticity lived near munich muumlnchen germany child year ago exact cooky ate back perfect mixture sweet spice lightly crunchy outside spongy soft inside brand variation suffice even fully chocolatecoated version still good throw delicate balance flavor literal translation lebkuchen life cake youve tried confection may understand whythey hard find local store ive reasonable luck finding cost plus world market usually ranging six eight buck per package although fly shelf fairly quickly almost chance reorder christmas
5,"greatest dog food ever, but the price jump the worst","I can't say enough about ZiwiPeak, hands down the best dog food on the market, both dry (11 lbs) and canned food. I have been buying them regularly and Whole Health Pet had the best price, special offers, shipping and service. Unfortunately, with the New Zealand manufacturer's new canning supplier and packaging, within two weeks Whole Health Pet started charging freight and their prices jumped up to $2.00 more average PER CAN (plus shipping), and $40 more PER BAG (plus shipping)!! I am not changing ZiwiPeak for my dogs, but I am buying elsewhere which has slightly lower price overall but with faster shipping. I feel I need to talk about the price, because while ZiwiPeak could be the best dog food ever, so many more dogs cannot have them because the price is simply beyond their owners' reach, not good.<br /><br />I hope Amazon Prime will pick up this line soon!!!",Positive,cant say enough ziwipeak hand best dog food market dry lb canned food buying regularly whole health pet best price special offer shipping service unfortunately new zealand manufacturer new canning supplier packaging within two week whole health pet started charging freight price jumped average per plus shipping per bag plus shipping changing ziwipeak dog buying elsewhere slightly lower price overall faster shipping feel need talk price ziwipeak could best dog food ever many dog price simply beyond owner reach goodi hope amazon prime pick line soon
5,THE best gluten-free cookie!,"I've found the holy grail of gluten-free cookies!! This shortbread is simply PERFECT: wonderfully light, crispy, and buttery; flavored just right; not too sweet--and I can eat it despite my numerous dietary restrictions! In fact, it's easy to forget that these wonders are gluten-, egg-, dairy-, corn- and transfat-free, because they just taste like a really well-made cookie (which they are) and not like some substitute-laden excuse for a cookie (which I'm sure you've endured if you have these dietary restrictions). I've also tried Sun Flour Baking Co.'s lemon shortbread (also sold here), and it is equally as satisfying. Maybe the ""lots of love"" listed in the ingredients is what is doing the culinary trick here, but whatever SFBC is doing, I hope they keep it up for a very long time!

4,Great Tasting Cookies!!,"My first experience with GF cookies.  Giving up the ""regular"" cookies, breads and pastas I love has been challenging, to say the least.  I purchased these cookies based on other reviews and I'm glad I did.  The taste, flavor and texture of these cookies is very good.  It was a bit disappointing that most of the cookies had broken, but I understand that's pretty common for GF baked goods, especially when they have to be shipped.  Nonetheless, they were good enough that none of the crumbles were wasted -- I just sprinkled them on top of vanilla ice cream and that was even better.  I most likely will order these again.  The package arrived quickly and in good shape with the cookies securely wrapped in plastic wrap over the paper-type cookie container.",Positive,first experience gf cooky giving regular cooky bread pasta love challenging say least purchased cooky based review im glad taste flavor texture cooky good bit disappointing cooky broken understand thats pretty common gf baked good especially shipped nonetheless good enough none crumbles wasted sprinkled top vanilla ice cream even better likely order package arrived quickly good shape cooky securely wrapped plastic wrap papertype cookie container

5,Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health,"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meats high on the list, flaxseed, good vitamins and antioxidants, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.",Positive,pet food industry one infuriating start research discovering trash manufacturer vet get paid manufacturer push onto unsuspecting public reference dont ask vet internet research site like example youll find even supposed highend line basically every major supermarket label horrible fuzzy friend people trust marketing trust vet overpay feed cat food full carcinogen cheap ingredient inappropriate cat digestive system byproduct provide nothing value basically way make cheap profit literal garbage tragedy cat end shorter lifespan kidney problem utis cancer host issue could avoided high quality foodthis agrade food youll find high protein content many meat high list flaxseed good vitamin antioxidant grain great cat omnivore carnivore simply need grainswhat find kind junk youll see thing like purina one science diet byproduct aka beak feather bird foot brewer rice aka waste product making beer wheat flour leading cause pet allergy corn gluten cheap waste space thing like liver flavor dont want pay real thing didnt pull ingredient air reading ingredient list purina one patheticdont feed cat trash pay little feed good food theyll lead longer healthier satisfied life result worth

I usually like a splash of cream, or lately a dab of honey.  So I give it a four, because it may not be as strong as I like but comes in individual packets so stays fresh, portable for my frequent camping/hiking trips, brews up to a taste that can be sipped plain, and organic with a amazing pre-brew aroma.",Positive,marley coffee beautiful strong aroma brewing like fresh ground bean amazed smell good strong brew mild almost weak sound like negative thats mean drink lot coffee year love strong brew time coffee mild drink plain usually like splash cream lately dab honey give four may strong like come individual packet stay fresh portable frequent campinghiking trip brew taste sipped plain organic amazing prebrew aroma

And most serious pie eaters know its the crust that makes the pie! Each box makes FOUR crusts, I think that is a bit of a stretch for a 9 inch pie, if you want a fancy fluted crust anyway.

3,Disappointed,"I was disappointed with the cube. It is almost impossible to open. Finally I used the handle of a pair of pliers, after seeing a video on youtube, and I tore up the handle of the pliers opening it, it was that hard. The kibble either doesn't come out, and my dog gets frustrated and barks, or it comes out 5 pieces at once, and I have to refill it all the time. It also slides along the ground more often than it rolls over to dispense kibble. Maybe that's because my dog is too small to roll it? He's 6 pounds.<br /><br />One more thing, the instructions both on the product and Buster Cube's website refer to ""min"" and ""max"" settings. There is no such thing on the cube, only ""lock"" and ""unlock"" settings.<br /><br />My dog loves it though, so it gets 3 stars.",Neutral,disappointed cube almost impossible open finally used handle pair plier seeing video youtube tore handle plier opening hard kibble either doesnt come dog get frustrated bark come piece refill time also slide along ground often roll dispense kibble maybe thats dog small roll he poundsone thing instruction product buster cube website refer min max setting thing cube lock unlock settingsmy dog love though get star

4,Dog loved them,"I handed out samples to my parents toy poodles and my Newfoundland and they all thoroughly enjoyed them. The size of the treat is more appropriate for a small to medium dog than my large Newf, though that didn't stop her from wanting one when I picked up the bag.<br /><br />The ingredient list is pretty basic, which is good. Preservatives always make me a little uneasy, but the list is much better than the typical grocery store brand. If they were a snack for me, I'd say they went a little too heavy on the smoke flavor. The dogs didn't mind, and the smell didn't seem to stay on my hands for too long.<br /><br />I won't be buying them again, but primarily because of my dog's size, and because she would much rather have a piece of broccoli or some beans than something out of a plastic bag (odd, I know).",Positive,handed sample parent toy poodle newfoundland thoroughly enjoyed size treat appropriate small medium dog large newf though didnt stop wanting one picked bagthe ingredient list pretty basic good preservative always make little uneasy list much better typical grocery store brand snack id say went little heavy smoke flavor dog didnt mind smell didnt seem stay hand longi wont buying primarily dog size would much rather piece broccoli bean something plastic bag odd know

5,Tastes Great but concerned about manufacturing processes,"To be completely and 100% fair, I have tried this product before and enjoyed it.  The only part that concerns me is that this product is manufactured in China, with no information on the sources of the fruits. On their website they say they ""source fresh fruit"" and that "" We are not concerned about issues surrounding where our product is produced because we take great care to ensure the quality and food safety of our products.""  I'm not suggesting that this product is bad (which is why I gave it 5 stars) but I share more of a concern than evidently the company does, as to where they are getting this fruit, processing it and shipping it.  With the history China has had with kid's toys/formula/etc in the past, let's just say we don't feed these products to our child.  I would love it if the company would provide a tour and exact explanation of the process and sources, rather than discounting that information all together.",Positive,completely fair tried product enjoyed part concern product manufactured china information source fruit website say source fresh fruit concerned issue surrounding product produced take great care ensure quality food safety product im suggesting product bad gave star share concern evidently company getting fruit processing shipping history china kid toysformulaetc past let say dont feed product child would love company would provide tour exact explanation process source rather discounting information together

5,Thank God for raw honey! Processed honey should be banned!,"Wanted to thank for such a great product! It's absolutely delicious! Its consistency and taste proves that it has not been processed or diluted with sugar and water. If you compare it with processed honey that is sold in stores you would actually feel there is a raw taste to this brand. Processed honey has syrup-like taste and it stays liquid for a long time. If you are looking for raw honey, you have to know that it changes its color and consistency over time.<br />I have also noticed that no matter how much you can eat it, this honey does not make your stomach upset unlike processed store brands.<br /><br />In order for honey to be beneficial it has to be raw! There is no way it can deliver all its goodness to you if it's been processed! Honey is a wonder food! It has been scientifically proven to help heal wounds as it has antibacterial properties; to help restore healthy intestinal flora as it is a prebiotic; help recover from illnesses faster; help you sleep better; restore your nervous system after stressful events (try a cup of herbal tea with raw honey after a stressful day!) and even make your skin contain moisture. Raw unprocessed honey does not make your sugar spike if you are diabetic. But it absolutely has to be raw! If you buy processed honey you just waste your money, you can as well just buy some high fructose corn syrup....<br />Thank you for selling your honey raw! I wish one day people will be educated enough to avoid processed foods.",Positive,wanted thank great product absolutely delicious consistency taste prof processed diluted sugar water compare processed honey sold store would actually feel raw taste brand processed honey syruplike taste stay liquid long time looking raw honey know change color consistency timei also noticed matter much eat honey make stomach upset unlike processed store brandsin order honey beneficial raw way deliver goodness processed honey wonder food scientifically proven help heal wound antibacterial property help restore healthy intestinal flora prebiotic help recover illness faster help sleep better restore nervous system stressful event try cup herbal tea raw honey stressful day even make skin contain moisture raw unprocessed honey make sugar spike diabetic absolutely raw buy processed honey waste money well buy high fructose corn syrupthank selling honey raw wish one day people educated enough avoid processed food

4,"Hot but not too hot - a nicely blended hot sauce. Purchase this ""extra hot "" variety. The regular version is Not Recommended","Lets face it - the Mexicans love hot food and generally know how to make a fine hot sauce. While the label (in small print) says ""extra hot"" there are many other sauces which are far hotter.  Think in terms of needing 5 or 6 drops for a bloody mary rather than spoonfuls when using this sauce. It is far from being ""extra hot"". I'd call it medium hot.<br /><br />Important: There is a significant difference between this ""extra hot"" variety of Valentina hot sauce and their regular variety. The easiest way to tell the two apart is the regular version has a light yellow background on the label and this one - the so called ""extra hot"" has a black background on the label. To my taste, the ""extra hot"" is far superior.<br /><br />Ingredients (as copied from the label): water, chili peppers, vinegar, salt ...<br /><br />Which chili peppers Valentina used is unknown, yet the company has certainly created a nice blend. You can easily detect some sweetness in this sauce and that has to be due to a nice blend of the chiles. There are no added sugars!<br /><br />Normally I don't like any vinegar in a hot sauce, yet I don't mind it all in this particular version of Valentina. The difference may be this sauce uses actual vinegar while most others use acetic acid (a chemical component of vinegar) and the chili peppers dominate in this particular variety of Valentina. I want to emphasize that this is ONLY true for this particular blend.<br /><br />The bottom line is this is a nicely blended hot sauce worthy of your consideration. My four star rating means this is a very good hot sauce but, depending on your palette, you might find a few that are better.<br /><br />Warning: there is a significant differences between the regular Valentina and the ""extra hot"" (black label) variety that I'm reviewing here. In the regular version a heavy taste of vinegar is painfully evident while the ""extra hot"" variety is much better balanced, ie, the vinegar is in the background. So it is quite important that you choose the extra hot version - the one with a black background on the label.<br /><br />This is a near perfect hot sauce for a bloody mary and most other foods.<br /><br />BTW: Watch out for sellers that price the sauce low but charge very high shipping charges on a per bottle basis",Positive,let face mexican love hot food generally know make fine hot sauce label small print say extra hot many sauce far hotter think term needing drop bloody mary rather spoonful using sauce far extra hot id call medium hotimportant significant difference extra hot variety valentina hot sauce regular variety easiest way tell two apart regular version light yellow background label one called extra hot black background label taste extra hot far superioringredients copied label water chili pepper vinegar salt chili pepper valentina used unknown yet company certainly created nice blend easily detect sweetness sauce due nice blend chile added sugarsnormally dont like vinegar hot sauce yet dont mind particular version valentina difference may sauce us actual vinegar others use acetic acid chemical component vinegar chili pepper dominate particular variety valentina want emphasize true particular blendthe bottom line nicely blended hot sauce worthy consideration four star rating mean good hot sauce depending palette might find betterwarning significant difference regular valentina extra hot black label variety im reviewing regular version heavy taste vinegar painfully evident extra hot variety much better balanced ie vinegar background quite important choose extra hot version one black background labelthis near perfect hot sauce bloody mary foodsbtw watch seller price sauce low charge high shipping charge per bottle basis

I literally could have been fooled into eating it myself.  It had a high moisture content and the chicken was shredded.  My cat at all the liquid and then went to work on the meat stuff.  Shredded isn't his favorite texture at all, but he finished all 3 oz in good order.<br /><br />Next was the chicken pot pie.  Decent smell too.  It was very watery though.

1,Not what I expected.,"I certainly could do better by these if I just went over to Grama's house and raided her flowerbeds. I am not sure what I truly expected but it was not a bag a teeny microscopic half brown buds. The package is not sealed and one side is just dust where the buds crumbled. I showed the pic of the good side to point out the brown ones. The smell upon opening was overwhelming with the first whiff. Then it evaporated immediately and left a strong rank tea like chemically enhanced odor. I assure you I will not be using these for human consumption due to that lingering odor.

2,not really worth it.,"this product is o.k. but i think you can get away w/out it and be fine ...not really worth the money. CONS: it only makes a very small amount of food at once. if I am going through the trouble, i'd rather make a bigger batch and freeze it. Also, the lid on the resevoir gets so hot and is shaped oddly so that it is difficult to get a grip of it to take off. a serious caution, the booklet i got w/ mine (purchased in 2008) has recipes that include foods that you are not supposed to give to babies under a year old!!!!!finally, the blend mode does not have an optional 'stay on' so that if you want to puree something, you need to stand there and hold the button. you can't do something else while it's blending b/c you need to be right there to keep it running. PROS: technically, it does what it says it does, and it is easy to clean. I find that even though i own this, i tend to use my good old pan w/ a steamer basket and then puree in my food processor. works just as well, saves time, and makes more at once.",Negative,product ok think get away wout fine really worth money con make small amount food going trouble id rather make bigger batch freeze also lid resevoir get hot shaped oddly difficult get grip take serious caution booklet got w mine purchased recipe include food supposed give baby year oldfinally blend mode optional stay want puree something need stand hold button cant something else blending bc need right keep running pro technically say easy clean find even though tend use good old pan w steamer basket puree food processor work well save time make

5,A REALLY big hit with my non-gf household!,"Well, this was the first time I tried a bread maker.  I followed some advice here and ended up with the dough overflowing, but maybe I did something wrong...  Anyway, I managed to get the just-starting-to-cook dough out of the machine and into 2 bread pans (that dough had REALLY risen!)and cooked them separately somewhat according to the directions on the box (since it was already partially cooked, and had an extra cup of water in it - and I did not put a pan of water under it while baking in the oven)and they came out looking unusual (very white on top) but were incredibly tasty!!  I'll second that it tastes a lot like a french bread.  Kind of crispy and chewy crust, very moist and fluffy inside.  Nothing like gf bread at all.  No one could believe how good it was!  I really think this would make an excellent pizza dough since the crust is so crispy and chewy.  Of course, these were the results of having it flop in the bread machine first.  I hope I can duplicate my results while avoiding another disaster! EXCELLENT BREAD!  Now, if only they could keep it in stock...<br /><br />Edited to add:  I've now tried this with less water (about 2 and 1/2 cups) and the loaf came out perfect!  I have also had my machine prepare the dough and before it started the baking cycle I took it out, divided it into 4, flattened circles (like pizza crusts), filled it with meat, sauce and cheese, and then folded it over and pinched the edges and baked it at 425 for about a 1/2 hour to 35 mins.

Also purchased the Organic Pumpkin as an added supplement that I now add to his regular daily feedings and he's losing weight each month.  Initially weighed in at a hefty 52 pounds, now weighs 46.5 pounds and he's enjoying far more energy, delicious meals and an improved interest in active (interactive) play times.  With his breed having a 10-12 year life expectancy, it's amazing to see how at eight and a half years of age, he's behaving more like a lively puppy again.",Positive,purchased two pkges fruitables allnatural pumpkin banana dog treat fruitables allnatural pumpkin apple dog treat resealabnle ounce pouch supplement natural fruitsveggies dog permitted diet love also purchased organic pumpkin added supplement add regular daily feeding he losing weight month initially weighed hefty pound weighs pound he enjoying far energy delicious meal improved interest active interactive play time breed year life expectancy amazing see eight half year age he behaving like lively puppy

3,Cat's are fickel,"My cat's are spoiled, I'm sure they aren't the only ones out there, but probably more spoiled than most.  The price of most cat treats and even some canned food is cheaper than Wally World, especially with a subscription.  These particular treats they love, until they get too many of them and then they want something different.  I tend to have four or five varieties on hand at any given time.  One cat seems to know that.  On any given day he knows what he wants but just looks at me until I figure it out.  If I just walk away, he will stalk me, or sit in front of the TV, or lay on the keyboard, whatever is most annoying until I give in and offer something else hoping I get it right.  I know, I'm whipped.  But be honest, if your thinking of buying these you probably are too.  Chances are good your cat will like them, mine do much of the time.  But they also like other flavors much of the time.  Price is a little more but packages are larger.  One strange thing with Amazon, different flavors of cat treats are different prices, even though they are all Temptations, Friskies, Party Mix, or whatever.",Neutral,cat spoiled im sure arent one probably spoiled price cat treat even canned food cheaper wally world especially subscription particular treat love get many want something different tend four five variety hand given time one cat seems know given day know want look figure walk away stalk sit front tv lay keyboard whatever annoying give offer something else hoping get right know im whipped honest thinking buying probably chance good cat like mine much time also like flavor much time price little package larger one strange thing amazon different flavor cat treat different price even though temptation friskies party mix whatever

5,gold bears vs goldbaren,"after tasting some of the competition recommended by some of the low reviews here, I have to say that these are the best. Better flavors, actual unique flavors with each color versus just having different colors that taste all the same, and they are supposed to be hard. That's why I like them. If you want softer bears, you may not like these though. Mine were fresh, you can tell when they are not.. the outsides start to get harder/dryer and perhaps a bit white looking. This brand gets rid of that gelatin flavor that tends to be more prevalent in the cheaper store bought stuff.<br /><br />For the ones here, made in Turkey, that you will be ordering...Not super-sweet, really the perfect amount of sweetness. Good flavor profiles. Compared to the bears made in Germany, they almost have a subtle vanilla flavor to all of them, and the flavors themselves are not as potent. Honestly I love them both, but I suggest trying them both. You won't notice the vanilla hint without something to compare by, similar to having 2 monitors next to each other to calibrate the other.<br /><br />Now the goldbaren, which can be found online as well...  Their consistency, or level of chewiness, mouthfeel, is almost identical. The german bears use glucose syrup instead of fructose syrup, and have an extra flavor.. the green is actually apple. The apple flavor has grown on me since I've used up the bags I've ordered. My prefernce now leans towards the german goldbaren versus the ones made in Turkey sold here. The flavors are stronger, more in your face, and fruity. The Turkish ones are blander, with a pleasing almost vanilla taste to them that I do enjoy.<br /><br />Bottom line, try both, they are both quite good, but distinctly different as well. Buy both, or pick your favorite.",Positive,tasting competition recommended low review say best better flavor actual unique flavor color versus different color taste supposed hard thats like want softer bear may like though mine fresh tell outside start get harderdryer perhaps bit white looking brand get rid gelatin flavor tends prevalent cheaper store bought stufffor one made turkey orderingnot supersweet really perfect amount sweetness good flavor profile compared bear made germany almost subtle vanilla flavor flavor potent honestly love suggest trying wont notice vanilla hint without something compare similar monitor next calibrate othernow goldbaren found online well consistency level chewiness mouthfeel almost identical german bear use glucose syrup instead fructose syrup extra flavor green actually apple apple flavor grown since ive used bag ive ordered prefernce lean towards german goldbaren versus one made turkey sold flavor stronger face fruity turkish one blander pleasing almost vanilla taste enjoybottom line try quite good distinctly different well buy pick favorite

5,Delicious alternative tea,"Runa is a brand new tea that I drink everyday. I love the balanced, energizing feel I get from it. Apparently guayusa has been drunk for thousands of years in the rain forests of Ecuador and is now making its way to market in the US for the first time. Runa also seems to have a great back story of environmental conservation and social empowerment of indigenous groups. In fact I just heard a story covered on NPR's Marketplace about the partnership between Runa, the socialist Ecuadorian government and the farmers.<br /><br />The Amazon Spice has a nice cinnamon undertone with high notes from the lemongrass, the Ginger Citrus is also really good and slightly spicier from the ginger with clean citrus zest flavor, the traditional is good to see what guayusa by itself tastes like- smooth and naturally, subtly sweet with no tannin. I've never had the spearmint but I bet its good for people who like mint tea.",Positive,runa brand new tea drink everyday love balanced energizing feel get apparently guayusa drunk thousand year rain forest ecuador making way market u first time runa also seems great back story environmental conservation social empowerment indigenous group fact heard story covered nprs marketplace partnership runa socialist ecuadorian government farmersthe amazon spice nice cinnamon undertone high note lemongrass ginger citrus also really good slightly spicier ginger clean citrus zest flavor traditional good see guayusa taste like smooth naturally subtly sweet tannin ive never spearmint bet good people like mint tea

1,Used to be good - and used to be reasonably priced,"A couple of years ago I discovered Seattle's Best French Roast ground coffee, which was delicious and a good value, as a 3-pack of 12 oz bags from Amazon was only $18.  This quickly became my daily coffee fix.  Recently, however, the original packaging changed (I understand the company was bought by Starbucks), and so did the coffee.  Now called Level 5, the coffee seems OK when brewed immediately after opening the bag, but beginning the next day or so after opening, a freshly brewed batch tastes burnt and has an odd chemical flavor.  Like another reviewer, I cleaned my pot and tried a different coffee maker (one at work), but the coffee still tastes bad. I have now tried all three bags from my last order, and each makes the same unpleasant coffee.  To compound this disppointing change in coffee quality, the price on Amazon has gone up from $18 (with free shipping via Amazon Prime) to $41.95 + shipping costs for a 3-pack from an outside supplier.  Amazon and Seattle's Best have both lost my business on this one.",Negative,couple year ago discovered seattle best french roast ground coffee delicious good value pack oz bag amazon quickly became daily coffee fix recently however original packaging changed understand company bought starbucks coffee called level coffee seems ok brewed immediately opening bag beginning next day opening freshly brewed batch taste burnt odd chemical flavor like another reviewer cleaned pot tried different coffee maker one work coffee still taste bad tried three bag last order make unpleasant coffee compound disppointing change coffee quality price amazon gone free shipping via amazon prime shipping cost pack outside supplier amazon seattle best lost business one

5,mmmmm I love this stuff!,"I got this for my husband who uses one of the old bar soaps known for leaving a ""sticky soap film"" behind.  He is a man of habit though and wouldn't use it even when I reminded him of the great commercial they had for the super bowl.  So, I hid his soap and left him with either this or puppy shampoo for his morning bath.  That did the trick! Not only that but this stuff has a really nice, subtle masculine scent.  mmmmmmmmm, I LIKE this stuff!  He smells sexy but not until you get really, really close, so I don't have to worry about the girls at work ""sniffing after him"".<br /><br />In the interest of writing a good review I did some additional research and used it on myself in the shower:  This product lathers nicely, and rinses very clean.  It does a good job of washing off sweat, dirt, grease, etc. without having to reapply.  After using it, I did not have dry or itchy skin and I felt clean and refreshed.  The scent was faint and kinda woodsy, it reminded me of sandlewood but very subtle.  While this product is for men, I would use it again.

4,"Great Fruit Snacks, but try some other flavors.","I absolutely love Annie's gummies, they healthy and yummy with an awesome texture. Texture is really important to me when it comes to fruit snacks, and these have an awesome soft texture. They aren't hard and you don't have to sit there chewing forever; but if you want you can suck not them and they won't just disintegrate or stick to the roof of you mouth. They are perfect! The only reason I gave this particular flavor a 4 instead of 5 stars, is it just doesn't taste as good to me as any of the other Annie's flavors. This particular flavor in my opinion was okay, but no where near as good as some other Annie's flavors. I recommend trying the Summer Strawberry and the Berry Patch flavors as well!!<br /><br />Another great fruit snack to try if you like this texture is Ocean Spray brand. They are not organic, but they are less than half the price of these. Mott's Medley's all natural fruit snacks are yummy as well and are made with both fruit and vegetable juices!

4,"Fine Tea Experience, With Caveats","****<br />This Cranberry Weightless tea is lovely, and has a marvelous taste. It seems to work as a diuretic, which isn't a bad thing, since it does so by promoting urological health. It probably does contribute to ""Weightless"" (weighing less) but only by ridding your body of excess water; still, if it can do this in a healthy way, I'm all for it. I like drinking it as a calming ritual before meals, which for me has some value, too. It seems to work for me; even more importantly, I enjoy it.<br /><br />The ingredients in Traditional Medicinal's Weightless Cranberry are: bitter fennel fruit 150 mg, red clover blossom 150 mg, uva ursi leaf 135 mg, cranberry fruit concentrate 60 mg, cleavers herb 52.5 mg., as well as a proprietary blend of: organic hibiscus flower, organic roasted chicory root, organic parsley leaf, and organic stevia leaf.<br /><br />Weightless Cranberry is part of a line by Traditional Medicinals that includes the original Weightless and a Weightless Cinnamon-Spice.<br /><br />Traditional Medicinals seems to be a responsible company. They adhere to sustainable and fair trade practices, use organic ingredients when feasible, and base their tea formulations on sound research and knowledge.<br /><br />The brewing instructions for this tea are very important: ""For maximum benefit, medicinal tea must be properly prepared. Pour 8 oz. freshly boiled water over a tea bag in a cup. Cover cup and steep 10-15 minutes. These steps directly influence the amount of beneficial components that will end up in your teacup! Gently squeeze the tea bag to release any remaining extract.<br />Drink 3 cups daily, one cup before each meal, for up to 2 weeks, then pause a few days before resuming."" So, Weightless is a long-brewing pre-prandial tea...if you want it to work properly.<br /><br />Also note the following cautions: ""Cautions: Tea containing bitter fennel fruit and uva ursi leaf are not for long-term daily use without medical advice. Contraindications: Not for use during pregnancy, while nursing, or by children under 12 years. Side Effects: Teas containing uva ursi leaf may cause nausea or vomiting in individuals and children with sensitive stomachs.""<br />****",Positive,cranberry weightless tea lovely marvelous taste seems work diuretic isnt bad thing since promoting urological health probably contribute weightless weighing less ridding body excess water still healthy way im like drinking calming ritual meal value seems work even importantly enjoy itthe ingredient traditional medicinals weightless cranberry bitter fennel fruit mg red clover blossom mg uva ursi leaf mg cranberry fruit concentrate mg cleaver herb mg well proprietary blend organic hibiscus flower organic roasted chicory root organic parsley leaf organic stevia leafweightless cranberry part line traditional medicinals includes original weightless weightless cinnamonspicetraditional medicinals seems responsible company adhere sustainable fair trade practice use organic ingredient feasible base tea formulation sound research knowledgethe brewing instruction tea important maximum benefit medicinal tea must properly prepared pour oz freshly boiled water tea bag cup cover cup steep minute step directly influence amount beneficial component end teacup gently squeeze tea bag release remaining extractdrink cup daily one cup meal week pause day resuming weightless longbrewing preprandial teaif want work properlyalso note following caution caution tea containing bitter fennel fruit uva ursi leaf longterm daily use without medical advice contraindication use pregnancy nursing child year side effect tea containing uva ursi leaf may cause nausea vomiting individual child sensitive stomach

Here's my trouble -- and it's very likely that it is MY trouble alone: I don't know how to make a cup of good, strong coffee using these tea-bag sort of coffee packets and a regular coffee machine.  I find that if you put these packets into the bottom of the coffee filter basket and run water through it, the water runs through too fast and the coffee is too weak.  I have tried using these like actual teabags, which definitely makes a better cup of coffee, but requires a little more time and supervision than I want.

5,I love Hills!,"My cat is picky, especially when it comes to dry food.  She will happily go days refusing to eat anything if I push a kibble she doesn't like on her (damn torties!.  I switched my cat from friskies to Hills Scienc Diet when she grew to adulthood.  Then I decided to try one of those natural diets, with no fillers, and only uses real meats and blah blah blah.  One she wouldn't go near, and the other she would eat reluctantly.

5,Great work and on the go tea,"I am a big fan of drinking tea, and love a good earl grey.  This is one of the best earl greys you can get, unless you upgrade to the loose leaf teas.  It's great at work and on the go, where you don't have time or equipment to brew loose leaf teas.  The tea holds up well through a range of temperatures and doesn't taste as bitter as some others out there.  I recommend brewing it at temperature below boiling to produce smoother flavor (I usually add a little bit of cold water to the cup before pouring in boiling water to control the steeping).  The only downside is it's a little expensive for 15 servings.  Would recommend without hesitation to anybody looking for a decent earl grey.",Positive,big fan drinking tea love good earl grey one best earl grey get unless upgrade loose leaf tea great work go dont time equipment brew loose leaf tea tea hold well range temperature doesnt taste bitter others recommend brewing temperature boiling produce smoother flavor usually add little bit cold water cup pouring boiling water control steeping downside little expensive serving would recommend without hesitation anybody looking decent earl grey
3,About what you'd expect,"Let's face it.  If you drink any sort of Crystal Light product and expect it to taste as good as the real deal, then you've probably set your expectations too high.  Crystal Light's Mocktail Margarita mix is and comes across as exactly what it is . . . a mix.  Tastes incomplete on it's own, but does a serviceable job when mixed with alcohol.  Not horrible, not great, but squarely in between.  A compact way to keep a decent mix around.  Best used if you're desperate to sling a lot of drinks inexpensively or as a gateway mix for college kids (or both).",Neutral,let face drink sort crystal light product expect taste good real deal youve probably set expectation high crystal light mocktail margarita mix come across exactly mix taste incomplete serviceable job mixed alcohol horrible great squarely compact way keep decent mix around best used youre desperate sling lot drink inexpensively gateway mix college kid

SILK soy milk was the first SM that I tried few years ago and it was the worst soy milk I ever tried. Watery, awful tasting. Furthermore SILK did not sell organic soy milk. I even tried to contact SILK to find out if their soy was a GM , they would not respond. Sweeteners are added to all Plain soy milk to change the bitter taste of soy but vanilla does not since vanilla is a sweetener itself so calories are the same but vanilla tastes better.

4,Great Tasting Cereal,"I'm a daily cereal consumer. My wife is a health fanatic so I eat mainly organic cereal with very little sugar and as little refinement as possible. So that being said it was a treat to be able to try Kellogg's Crunchy Nut cereal. With 10g of sugar per 3/4 cup serving it is quite a bit sweeter then I'm used to. (Compare with Kellogg's Fruit Loops at 12g of sugar per 1 cup serving). Although it looks like Cheerios with nuts on it, it is not - the texture is heavier and crunchier and the taste is completely different. The nuts add a nice touch even though it would probably taste great without them. The vitamin content is quite high which means they probably fortified the cereal although I see nothing on the box that states this.<br /><br />As I said I enjoyed trying this cereal but knowing my wife (bless her heart) she won't be buying this cereal for me any time soon.

4,Good Dark/Light Blend,"I'm a coffee drinker that prefers to grind my own beans because it is fresher that way. The more recently it was roasted the better. I like dark, hearty coffees, but not ones that have been over-roasted. A select few ground coffees can be good, and this is one of them. Melitta strikes a nice balance between the light and dark roasts. The dark roast predominates but the light roast helps make it smooth and flavorful. This is a fine grind and makes a more potent pot of coffee than similar amounts of your standard ground coffees like Foldgers or Maxwell House.<br /><br />They've priced this mid-range coffee competitively and I would recommend it to people who appreciate a flavorful, aromatic coffee. It cannot replace just roasted and freshly ground coffee, but you'd be hard pressed to find something much better outside of a gourmet shop. I've used Melitta's filters for years, and now I'm enjoying their coffees as well. Because of the Blanc et Noir Ground blend, I tried their <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ5GTO"">Colombian Medium Roast</a> and found it to be quite good as well.",Positive,im coffee drinker prefers grind bean fresher way recently roasted better like dark hearty coffee one overroasted select ground coffee good one melitta strike nice balance light dark roast dark roast predominates light roast help make smooth flavorful fine grind make potent pot coffee similar amount standard ground coffee like foldgers maxwell housetheyve priced midrange coffee competitively would recommend people appreciate flavorful aromatic coffee replace roasted freshly ground coffee youd hard pressed find something much better outside gourmet shop ive used melittas filter year im enjoying coffee well blanc et noir ground blend tried colombian medium roast found quite good well

It's a nice alternative to soda, although an 8.3 ounce can of Back Cherry Switch has 30g of sugar. It's not thick but the sweetness does hit you! One thing that raises my eyebrow (besides the after-taste) was the price of the case. A 24 pack of cans that are slightly smaller than a can of soda for $24 is a little on the high side. Consider a 12 pack of Pepsi (or if you like Coke) which is roughly about $5.99 per pack. If you get 2 packs, you're only paying $12, but if you get a 24 pack of Switch, then your paying over $20 (for smaller cans than).",Positive,bad sugary black cherry taste overall bad slight bitter taste nice alternative soda although ounce back cherry switch g sugar thick sweetness hit one thing raise eyebrow besides aftertaste price case pack can slightly smaller soda little high side consider pack pepsi like coke roughly per pack get pack youre paying get pack switch paying smaller can
1,Our cats no longer will touch any of it.,"We are involved with cat rescue, and prefer to give canned, no-grain food.  Between ours and the ones we're fostering until we find them homes, we have 43 cats.  MOST of the cats won't touch Wellness anymore.  They used to eat it and it was all they were given, so I can't imagine why, for the past several months, they are refusing it.  Today, we threw two more cans (Chx & Beef and Chx flavors) down the disposal.  We can't afford to throw the stuff away, so we're now looking for other no-grain canned food they'll eat.  It's ridiculous.  It's almost as if the recipe changed, and it's across the board, with all flavors - we also give them the poultry and salmon (purple can) and the turkey (green can) formulas, in addition to the two I already mentioned.

5,Sun-Dried Olives and Almonds (Olive Essicate con Mandorle),"For some you will have to aquire a taste for the way these olives are cured. If you are willing to try it and hang in there it is well worth it though. These have already been prepared for you but you can still add your own olive oil and any other spices you may like to them. The flesh of these olives after being cured is meaty with a slight bitter to them. They play off the almonds very well. The almonds in this mixture are soft, smooth (almost creamy) and offset the slight bitter in the olive. I prefer to eat one or two olives and then follow up with an almond. You can even eat both simultaneously. The olives do have pits so be careful. Don't just bite down into one or you may damage a tooth. Eat the flesh of the olive off of the pit. I prefer to add some of my own extra virgin olive oil but it is up to your individual taste. This would go great on an antipasta tray or served with some cheeses and maybe some wine.

For use in Italian sodas, this is *completely* undrinkable.  I've confirmed this with a few friends to make sure I wasn't just being a bitch.  Others reviewers here have mentioned using this syrup in yogurt, and I did try a couple pumps in a strawberry smoothie, and the dairy did seem to help cover up the poison/medicinal overtones.<br />  In short, I cannot recommend this flavor.

With that being said, I came across this product about 6 months ago and my three cats love it. None of my cats like the soft food that is usually cut or shaped into squares. When I did serve my cats this type of food, my cats just lapped up the sauces, but left the food behind. With this product, my cats lick the bowl clean. The local stores only carry the variety packs, which contain three different kinds of Purrfectly Fish. None of my cats are fond of the mackerel, so I usually ended up with those packages left over.

5,My favorite coffee K-cup so far,"I first tried this brand and blend as part of a k-cup sampler pack. I was immediately in love with this k-cup! It's my very favorite so far. My personal preference for coffee is a nice bodied medium roast, and this more than fits the bill. It has the smoothest taste of the 6 or 7 medium roasts/breakfast blends that I have tried so far. If you like high octane, this is not going to be your favorite k-cup, but you would certainly enjoy it as a nice change of pace every now and then. My benchmark for a good k-cup is that I can use the large (9oz) setting on my Keurig and still get a cup of real coffee, not coffee flavored water. This passes the test with flying colors. If I need a kick in the pants to get out the door in the morning, I drop down to the 7oz setting for a slightly stronger brew. I like the fact that the taste remains smooth, even if I make it a little stronger.

3,Dark Roast Production Problems,"Having used the Senseo Dark Roast pods for years, I was happy when Amazon got them back in stock.  But the coffee is now undrinkable--it is incredibly bitter; I ended up throwing it out.  To make sure it was not just me, I made a cup for a friend who LOVES the Dark Roast, and she also said that it was very bitter.<br /><br />Called Senseo.  The rep said that he had gotten other complaints of a similar nature: that the new blend was bitter.  He said that it might have been a problem at the factory, since the new batches were supposed to taste the same as the older batches.  (The former factory has closed down, and they are manufacturing the new batches in a different factory.)  However, the new bags also say ""French Roast' not just ""Dark Roast"" so this may account for the difference--but French roasted coffee should not be bitter.<br /><br />For those who are concerned that the pods no longer say ""Senseo"" on the top, they are not counterfeit.  I was told that Senseo decided to eliminate the printing, since it made the pod fractionally thicker and some customers had problems with the top of the pod tearing.  Removing the printing would hopefully do away with this problem.  However, this is the least of my worries, since these pods will have to be thrown out and I do not have any of the older Senseo Dark Roast pods remaining.<br /><br />UPDATE: The following day, having written the scathing review above, I decided to open another bag and see if those pods were as awful as those in the first bag before I threw out all remaining five bags of pods.<br /><br />To my surprise, these pods were fine and the coffee tasted just like the older version.  Clearly there is a problem in the production in the new factory.  I did not want to open the other four bags now, since they would lose their freshness, but it is still possible that the coffee in some of those is also horrible.  But at least I feel better knowing that Senseo did not change the formula for the Dark Roast.  Now they just have to get their production kinks worked out.<br /><br />Amazon, of course, was great in dealing with the problem.",Neutral,used senseo dark roast pod year happy amazon got back stock coffee undrinkableit incredibly bitter ended throwing make sure made cup friend love dark roast also said bittercalled senseo rep said gotten complaint similar nature new blend bitter said might problem factory since new batch supposed taste older batch former factory closed manufacturing new batch different factory however new bag also say french roast dark roast may account differencebut french roasted coffee bitterfor concerned pod longer say senseo top counterfeit told senseo decided eliminate printing since made pod fractionally thicker customer problem top pod tearing removing printing would hopefully away problem however least worry since pod thrown older senseo dark roast pod remainingupdate following day written scathing review decided open another bag see pod awful first bag threw remaining five bag podsto surprise pod fine coffee tasted like older version clearly problem production new factory want open four bag since would lose freshness still possible coffee also horrible least feel better knowing senseo change formula dark roast get production kink worked outamazon course great dealing problem

5,The Best Italian Seasoning,"This seasoning blend used to be carried in our local store, and then suddenly we couldn't find it ANYWHERE.  I'm so happy to be able to order it!  It's so much more than your regular, grocery-store mix of oregano, parsley, and other greenery.<br /><br />We use it in so many things.  Of course, it's great in our Italian dishes.  It's also livened up things such as sausage balls, spinach dip (SO GOOD), and even just oven-baked chicken.  I never thought I'd order spices online, and I never thought I'd be so happy to see a package arrive.  :)",Positive,seasoning blend used carried local store suddenly couldnt find anywhere im happy able order much regular grocerystore mix oregano parsley greenerywe use many thing course great italian dish also livened thing sausage ball spinach dip good even ovenbaked chicken never thought id order spice online never thought id happy see package arrive
5,Great price and variety!  Do multiple rinses though...,"I haven't yet tried the morels which are of course the gems of the litter, but of the three other varieties I've tried, these are great!  An ounce is quite a lot actually...I'm going to get 2-3 uses out of each bag.<br /><br />I've never rehydrated mushrooms before but it's pretty easy and has some great benefits.  While the texture isn't the same as cooking with fresh mushrooms it lets you have all these varieties any time of the year and the ""liquor"" that you get from the water they rehydrate in is flavorful and great for using in sauces (sometimes the same recipe as the mushrooms).<br /><br />One caveat though - I had looked up instructions online and then compared them with the labels.  I followed the instructions on the labels at first but found one important thing that the internet had suggested - you really do need to carefully wash these and strain the liquor if you're going to use it.  That's because there IS sand and grit on a few of the mushrooms.  (Overall they seem fairly clean, but I bit into a few grains of sand the first few times I used them because of skipping this step)<br /><br />Anyway, this is a FANTASTIC price and a great way to try these varieties if you never have since most aren't available in a lot of grocery stores.  My palate is inexperienced in most of these varieties but they seem good to me...nice big mushrooms that rehydrate well and are full of flavor.<br /><br />Finally, I did separately order a variety of other products from Earthy direct from their website.  They have a lot of stuff there (sauces, spices, gourmet treats) and their other products are fantastic thus far as well.  Watch prices though...although it's nice to get all your little treats in one place, some items really are cheaper here on Amazon.<br /><br />Customer service from Earthy is great as well...I would assume they'd treat Amazon orders as well as they treat their direct traffic.  I had an issue (my fault) with an order from their website and they were incredibly helpful fixing it.",Positive,havent yet tried morel course gem litter three variety ive tried great ounce quite lot actuallyim going get us bagive never rehydrated mushroom pretty easy great benefit texture isnt cooking fresh mushroom let variety time year liquor get water rehydrate flavorful great using sauce sometimes recipe mushroomsone caveat though looked instruction online compared label followed instruction label first found one important thing internet suggested really need carefully wash strain liquor youre going use thats sand grit mushroom overall seem fairly clean bit grain sand first time used skipping stepanyway fantastic price great way try variety never since arent available lot grocery store palate inexperienced variety seem good menice big mushroom rehydrate well full flavorfinally separately order variety product earthy direct website lot stuff sauce spice gourmet treat product fantastic thus far well watch price thoughalthough nice get little treat one place item really cheaper amazoncustomer service earthy great welli would assume theyd treat amazon order well treat direct traffic issue fault order website incredibly helpful fixing

1,Don't buy this! Too coarse,Made the mistake of ordering this product. This coffee is WAY too coarse to use. The result is that the coffee tastes weak and bland. You have to use a TON of coffee to get any taste whatsoever and even then it doesn't taste very good. Now I'm stuck with 4 cans.

1,Total rip off,"I'm surprised no one has noted how much water is in the package and how little fat (only 1.4%).  This Weruva flavor, for example, has 85% water (only 15% dry ingredients).  Here is what the FDA says on its web site:<br /><br />""It is especially important to look at the moisture guarantee for canned foods, even when comparing a canned food with another canned. Under AAFCO regulations, the maximum percentage moisture content for a pet food is 78%, except for products labeled as a ""stew,"" ""in sauce,"" ""in gravy,"" or similar terms. The extra water gives the product the qualities needed to have the appropriate texture and fluidity. Some of these exempted products have been found to contain as much as 87.5% moisture. This doesn't sound like much difference until the dry matter contents are compared. For example, a product with a guarantee of 87.5% moisture contains 12.5% dry matter, only half as much as a product with a 75% moisture guarantee (25% dry matter).""<br /><br />On top of the nutrition problems, Weruva is ripping you off on a cost basis (this is my comment, not the FDA's). Looking at the dry ingredients, Weruba is charging you about $2 per ounce ($1.60 per 0.825 oz dry ingredients in a 5.5 oz can).  The top premium cat foods charge about $1 per ounce of dry ingredients.  Avoderm is 80 cents per 1 oz dry weight.  Science Diet is less than 70 cents per oz dry weight.  So Weruva is nearly 3 times the cost for ingredients other than water comparing Science Diet.<br /><br />So if you have a lot of money to waste and don't mind your cats having dry hair and other skin problems from lack of essential fats in the diet, then go for Weruva.  Otherwise, wait until they drop their price and increase the fat content.",Negative,im surprised one noted much water package little fat weruva flavor example water dry ingredient fda say web siteit especially important look moisture guarantee canned food even comparing canned food another canned aafco regulation maximum percentage moisture content pet food except product labeled stew sauce gravy similar term extra water give product quality needed appropriate texture fluidity exempted product found contain much moisture doesnt sound like much difference dry matter content compared example product guarantee moisture contains dry matter half much product moisture guarantee dry matteron top nutrition problem weruva ripping cost basis comment fda looking dry ingredient weruba charging per ounce per oz dry ingredient oz top premium cat food charge per ounce dry ingredient avoderm cent per oz dry weight science diet less cent per oz dry weight weruva nearly time cost ingredient water comparing science dietso lot money waste dont mind cat dry hair skin problem lack essential fat diet go weruva otherwise wait drop price increase fat content

5,"Lightly smokey, not too salty - perfect for a sandwich","These sardines really stand out as the best national brand.  I like them because they are always found in perfect condition in the can, with their silvery skins sparkling, and heads and tails neatly trimmed away.  The flavor is delicate, lightly smokey and not too salty.  Though oilier than sardines packed in other sauces, rest assured that these contain pure olive oil and the natural fats of the fishes, which make them a good source of heart-healthy omega-3.  Drained of oil, they are roughly 150 calories per can.  The ingredients are simple:  Sardines, olive oil, and salt.<br /><br />How to eat them?<br /><br />Well, they are excellent right out of the can!  Most of the time, I decant them for draining and make an open-faced sandwich. They are very good on toasted Fisherman's Warf type sourdough bread, lightly spread with mayo, sweet pickle relish, and a dash or two of Tobasco.  The result is a nice midnight snack which never upsets the stomach.<br /><br />Finally, given the long shelf life, these cans of tiny fish would make a good addition to an emergency food supply.

3,Great tasting diet tea... sometimes,"When mixed perfectly, the MIO Mango Peach iced tea tastes like a diet version of Chili's Mango iced tea which I am a big fan of.<br /><br />The problem is that it is next to impossible to get a consistent strength. I try for 2 medium squirts for the right flavor, but there is no practical way to measure how much mix you are putting in your glass. It squirts out too hard to measure with a measuring spoon. So, some days it is too strong, and I end up dumping the whole thing. Other days, it starts too weak. Of course, adding more makes it too strong. Like Goldilocks, some days, it ends up just right, and it tastes great.<br /><br />The bottle says that it has 24 servings. I haven't been counting, but it seems like a lot more than 24.",Neutral,mixed perfectly mio mango peach iced tea taste like diet version chili mango iced tea big fan ofthe problem next impossible get consistent strength try medium squirt right flavor practical way measure much mix putting glass squirt hard measure measuring spoon day strong end dumping whole thing day start weak course adding make strong like goldilocks day end right taste greatthe bottle say serving havent counting seems like lot

I think the cost of this cat food for the convenience is not worth it-now if it were a 5-6 oz. can, then I probably would think it was a reasonable trade off.

5,Objective & Subjective (from a particular buyer),"This review is for the 24 pack of 3 Oz. cans of the Wellness Brand Cat Food.<br /><br />Objectively speaking...<br />The cans are easy to ope and they have consistently arrived in excellent condition.  There are 24 cans at 3 oz. each.  That's all I can really say objectively about cat food.<br /><br />Subjectively speaking...<br />I could not believe the difference in my cats after switching to a canned cat food from dry food.  My cats are 15 and 16 years old.  They are healthy indoor cats who are still active and playful with no real health problems aside from my 16 year old cat having minor diabetes.  I had been feeding a high priced prescription (vet recommended) dry food for the last 2 years only to have my 15 year old cat begin getting sick and regurgitating his food on a weekly basis.  I took my cat to the vet repeatedly asking why this might be a problem.  The vet simply told me that the cat may be a little under the weather or it was hairball related...which before had not been an issue.  After a conversation with a friend in Dec 2010 they emphatically recommended canned cat food.  I decided to do some research and was I glad that I did.  My cats have been eating canned food for 2 months now and here are the changes I've noticed.  My cat who was throwing up 2-4 times a week has only done so 4 times in 2 months (and I think that was because he was biting at some straw that I didn't know about), their fur is ridiculously softer...like I just spent an hour brushing them, now it feels that way all the time.  And although my cats are not prone to hairballs, my medium haired cat would get them on occasion and he has had only 1 very small one in 2 months as opposed to the weekly ones I'd find in the house.  They have more energy and they just seem happier in how they interact and the littler box has less to be cleaned up and quite frankly it smells less offensive than it did before.  Don't get me wrong...cat boxes smell but I've been told (and now I feel I can attest to this) that dry food would dehydrate a cat and it would enter a system and absorb odors from the body and carry them out into the cat box to amplify the foul odors.  Actual cat food like the Wellness brand (not many brands are grain or rice free)  gets more fully digested by the cat and does not contain grains and rices and other fillers that are expelled with the body.  I must say that I felt the fool not having taken more time to learn about the diet possibilities of my cats.<br /><br />I will note that I also use the Wellness dry food (about 1/4 to 1/2 cup out each night) for my 2 cats to eat between their canned meals.  This is also to keep them used to eating a little dry food in case I am in a situation where I cannot provide their can in the morning and night.  For your reference I feed my cats each 1/2 a can in the morning and 1/2 in the evening (so 2 cans total daily).  I am going to switch to the 12 oz cans though because they are much cheaper, you nearly double your canned food for the same price, I'm just going to buy a resealable lid and scoop out what is needed.<br /><br />And as a side note, my cats eat most of the food when I leave it out but they do not finish it all.  I do leave the food out for them to finish up which they usually do within 1-3 hours.  Some people say you should never do this, some say they will leave it out all day...in my experience over the 2 months I have noticed no mold, illness or rejection of this food being left out for a few hours for my cats.  The longest I've seen food remain in the is at the 7 hour mark and still, it was finished with no negative behaviors or effects noticed in either of my animals.<br /><br />I hope this review helps you and please be aware specifically of what goes into certain brands.  There are cheaper canned foods but they are not as good as this brand.  I've checked and tried a few.  This one is really different.  There are a few websites which explain the health benefits more precisely and if you won't take my word for it on this brand see for yourself.  Also, the cost is well worth the response you will get from your cat and when measured against prescription dry food it really hasn't been much different and the 12 oz sizes will make it even more affordable.

3,Not My Favorite,I was really intrigued with this product.  I seemed to promise a new choice is artificial sweeteners.  On the plus side it comes in a small container that has 140 serving.  On the minus side you need to measure each serving out a 1/4 teaspoons at a time so it would be easy to get fewer serving than promised.  Another minus are the ingredients.  It states that the sweetener is made from monk fruit but that is the third ingredients listed.  Sugar is listed before Monk Fruit.  That makes me wonder if there are calories when you use more that the 1/4 teaspoon.  The last minus for me was the aftertaste.  I found it very strong.  With the ingredients minus and the aftertaste minus I cannot recommend this natural No Calorie Sweetener.,Neutral,really intrigued product seemed promise new choice artificial sweetener plus side come small container serving minus side need measure serving teaspoon time would easy get fewer serving promised another minus ingredient state sweetener made monk fruit third ingredient listed sugar listed monk fruit make wonder calorie use teaspoon last minus aftertaste found strong ingredient minus aftertaste minus recommend natural calorie sweetener

The grind has a slight sour smell when brewing, which in turn gives a slight bitter taste.<br />Good JBMC is very smooth; on the lighter side; slightly sweet and spicy with a nice finish.  Like good 100% Kona coffee, there is no bitter aftertaste.<br />I tried different grinds, #16 and #24, and prefer the #24 grind for a single cup brew.<br />The place I normally get this bean from (Lion Coffee) did get a fresh batch of JBMC beans in last week, so I was able to compare both; and the Lion JBMC roasted whole bean wins hands down.<br />My recommendation is that if you are willing to spend $30-$50 a pound for JBMC beans, make sure it's direct from one of their certified distributors like Mavis Banks.",Neutral,ive purchased jbmc whole bean different roaster year wanted share experience particular selleri running low normal supply jbmc decided give seller try slightly lower price stock shipped immediatelymy opinion jbmc bean seller either old something went wrong roasting process grind slight sour smell brewing turn give slight bitter tastegood jbmc smooth lighter side slightly sweet spicy nice finish like good kona coffee bitter aftertastei tried different grind prefer grind single cup brewthe place normally get bean lion coffee get fresh batch jbmc bean last week able compare lion jbmc roasted whole bean win hand downmy recommendation willing spend pound jbmc bean make sure direct one certified distributor like mavis bank

5,Excellent Quality Basmati Rice,"I think this rice is fantastic.  I have not had any of the packaging problems some other people have mentioned (and I would not be happy if I did - I do hope that issue is resolved).  Mine arrived fully intact and the rice itself is of the highest quality I have ever seen.  This is a product from Pakistan as that is clearly marked on the bag I purchased.  I use a little less water than is recommended by my rice cooker and it has always come out absolutely perfectly.  Each rice kernal is separated and fluffy and perfect.  Flavorful and aromatic.  I just love it.  I also highly recommend the Aroma ARC-856 rice cooker that is sold by Amazon.<br /><br />Here is how I cook this rice.  Using the measuring cup from my rice cooker - 2 cups of rice, 2 and 1/3rd cups of water, a tablespoon of toasted sesame oil (I use extra virgin olive oil if out), a taste of butter, sea salt, a dash of cinamon and a fair amount of fresh ground black pepper.  My mouth is watering just typing this :)<br /><br />I would love to read your favorite recipe in my comments section.",Positive,think rice fantastic packaging problem people mentioned would happy hope issue resolved mine arrived fully intact rice highest quality ever seen product pakistan clearly marked bag purchased use little less water recommended rice cooker always come absolutely perfectly rice kernal separated fluffy perfect flavorful aromatic love also highly recommend aroma arc rice cooker sold amazonhere cook rice using measuring cup rice cooker cup rice rd cup water tablespoon toasted sesame oil use extra virgin olive oil taste butter sea salt dash cinamon fair amount fresh ground black pepper mouth watering typing would love read favorite recipe comment section
1,imposter product,"My cats have been eating this for several years and up to now-have loved it.  I have purchased this product from pet shops and amazon.  This last shipment from amazon is not the same product as the label claims.  When the can is opened, it initially looks and smells like salmon, but underneath the 1/8 inch of a top layer of the real looking stuff, is something else.  It looks like a wee bit of the real product was sprayed over an imposter product, because it is not the same underneath, nor does it look or smell the same.  My cat vomited with the first feeding.  My cats don't like it now.  they eat the salmon coating and leave the rest.  I want to know where amazon got this batch of cans, because it is not Dick Van Pattens Natural Balance. Someone is duping us and we are paying a high price for a fraud.

5,The best,"I have tried every ""good"" cat food on the market.  My babies only would eat the dorito's of the cat food market, F**** F****.  Usually chicken sometimes turkey sometimes beef, sometimes I would have to go thru all three flavors until they honored me with eating.... I know, I am a mess.  The two adult babies (6lbs and 17lbs) would eat 4-5 cans a day with dry also available.  The poo was horrible smelling.<br /><br />Wally world was clearing this out one day so I bought a couple cans.  OMG they both scarfed it down.  I went back to get the rest but it was gone.  No longer were my babies interested in the bad food.  This is shocking since I had tried everything after the pet food debacle a few years ago (even tried the frozen meat) and they wouldn't eat anything else.  I only use one of the larger cans a day and their poo smell has drastically lessened.<br /><br />I cant get this local so am thrilled to find it here with free shipping.  I LOVE Amazon, anything I need I come here first and what is better than having your purchases delivered to your door???<br /><br />I cant say your cats will eat this but if they are not hyper picky they should.  (I tried turkey/chicken and no go, has to be chicken rice) And you really DO feed a lot less with this food! I am saving money and getting better food.

5,Old World Delights,"These traditional Italian and Greek culinary delights are preserved in the ancient manner (Brine and Salt) and are from the perennial fishing grounds of the Meditterean Sea rather than Peru or who knows where? These are premium Anchovies whose quality far exceeds the supermarket variety. These anchovies are nothing like the slender, stiff, olive oil soaked fillet ""saltbombs"" found in the little 2OZ tins or glass jars at supermarkets everywhere. It would take about 16 of these tiny 2 OZ cans to approximate the same amount sold here. At up to $2.50 for 2OZ fillets X 16 the economic advantage becomes clear. In any case, it is the exceptional quality, size and flavor that should guide your purchase.<br /> As a bonus (if prepared correctly) they have a much reduced sodium content. It is true that they require simple preparation: Rinse the salt and soak in fresh water for about a 1/2 hour before filleting and easily removing the spine bone and optionally scales. A simple task that is rewarded by a supple, meaty anchovy fillet that makes any dish requiring anchovies as good as it can get. I usually soak and fillet the contents of the entire can in advance and put them in a small jar submerged in olive oil and store in the refrigerator for long term availability. You can also store the unused portion in the can they were packed in by salting the next exposed layer as the item description suggests but, for me, fiddling with plastic wrap and exposing the fish to absorb the flavor of the can in the refrigerator is solved by re-packing them in a convienient sealable container.<br />Used in pasta dishes with roasted grape tomatoes,sliced garlic, and olive oil(Acciughe + Pomodoro) you'll soon wish the can was even bigger. Try a three or four of them mashed with a few cloves of garlic & a tablespoon or two of tomato paste and add to beef stew for that subltle ""Umami"" flavor that enhances the beef flavor without any ""Fishy"" taste. Diners (including fussy children) will detect there's somthing special, but will not suspect fish had anything to do with it. It has the same effect as Worchester sauce or Thai fish sauce which is essentially fermented fish. These savory anchovies melt away in a variety of sauces and stews. Great(for anchovy lovers) on Pizza, salads, Anchovy butter for steaks- you get the idea... Having them handy will encourage their regular use. You will definitly want to add them to your regular cooking arsenal.",Positive,traditional italian greek culinary delight preserved ancient manner brine salt perennial fishing ground meditterean sea rather peru know premium anchovy whose quality far exceeds supermarket variety anchovy nothing like slender stiff olive oil soaked fillet saltbombs found little oz tin glass jar supermarket everywhere would take tiny oz can approximate amount sold oz fillet x economic advantage becomes clear case exceptional quality size flavor guide purchase bonus prepared correctly much reduced sodium content true require simple preparation rinse salt soak fresh water hour filleting easily removing spine bone optionally scale simple task rewarded supple meaty anchovy fillet make dish requiring anchovy good get usually soak fillet content entire advance put small jar submerged olive oil store refrigerator long term availability also store unused portion packed salting next exposed layer item description suggests fiddling plastic wrap exposing fish absorb flavor refrigerator solved repacking convienient sealable containerused pasta dish roasted grape tomatoessliced garlic olive oilacciughe pomodoro youll soon wish even bigger try three four mashed clove garlic tablespoon two tomato paste add beef stew subltle umami flavor enhances beef flavor without fishy taste diner including fussy child detect there somthing special suspect fish anything effect worchester sauce thai fish sauce essentially fermented fish savory anchovy melt away variety sauce stew greatfor anchovy lover pizza salad anchovy butter steak get idea handy encourage regular use definitly want add regular cooking arsenal

Extremely woody and very hard to chew on the outside layer, tender in the middle, with a terrible bitter aftertaste.  There are distributed by Manischewitz, a generally reliable vendor of food products.  This, however, is a travesty!

5,"~*~*~My Girls LOVE these, PERFECT SIZE for Little Fingers~*~*~","When we first started giving these to our daughters we had to keep a very close eye on them(as with any solid food) because sometimes they would start choking and we would have to stick our fingers in their mouths and get these out.<br /><br />These do 'dissolve' pretty easily but your baby may take a little getting used to eating them like mine did. But in no time they knew how to eat these with OUT choking. I think at first they were just trying to swallow them before they got wet and 'dissolved'.<br /><br />We have bought Walmart Store Brand & these Gerber Puffs. Walmart Brand is Good but Gerber brand is GREAT! The Gerber Puffs are bigger making them easier for tiny fingers to pick them up, yet they are still a small enough size for them to eat. Walmart Brand have a lot of broken pieces so many of the pieces are tiny and my girls can't pick them up to eat them, I don't know that I have ever found a broken Gerber piece. I think Gerber stays fresh longer, it seems not too long after I open a Walmart Brand they are stale feeling.<br /><br />Since I have twins we go through these fast so we've found it much cheaper to order them in bulk.<br /><br />These keep my girls happy while my husband and I eat or get things done.

Well, that's good to know but we need a things that are easier to eat. In part, we make up concoctions of our own dishes but reduced to a mush. In addition, my wife found this Earth's Best Organic line of baby foods at a local store. They have quite a lineup of foods, but the brand and all varieties can be a little hard to find.<br /><br />One thing he seems to like are fruit and grain mixtures, so we picked up a variety pact as well as individual jars and we include a jar in his daily intake. My wife likes the organic aspect with no preservatives or additives and the baby seems to enjoy the foods.

The aroma when perking is also great.  For the price, you can't go wrong.  The Aroma Rood is the only one we have tried, but I'm sure the other types are good also.

They mix well with alcoholic beverages as well.<br /><br />HOWEVER<br /><br />I encourage everyone to visit the SodaStream webstore BEFORE purchasing any of products here. There are many flavors at the SodaStream webstore not offered here like DIET Energy and DIET Orange.  Also, as of 2/15/2012, they charge 40-50% less at the SodaStream webstore but you may have to pay for shipping.  However, if you buy 10 bottles at Sodastream, you'll get 1 bottle free.  I'm not slamming the Amazon merchants but I think consumers should be aware of the significant price mark-up.<br /><br />(With this exception, I've found Amazon prices to be competitive with other stores so I continue to be an Amazon Prime Member.)<br /><br />If you only want one bottle, it may make sense to pay twice as much with free Amazon Prime shipping.",Positive,sample find one like youll miss judge tasting one two favorite diet orange diet raspberrycranberry diet energy diet dr pete diet root beer arent bad either mix well alcoholic beverage wellhoweveri encourage everyone visit sodastream webstore purchasing product many flavor sodastream webstore offered like diet energy diet orange also charge less sodastream webstore may pay shipping however buy bottle sodastream youll get bottle free im slamming amazon merchant think consumer aware significant price markupwith exception ive found amazon price competitive store continue amazon prime memberif want one bottle may make sense pay twice much free amazon prime shipping

I've got to warn guys off of this useless ""tool.""<br /><br />This thing was obviously designed by a woman. Trying to be ""proper"" with my comments, women don't have the same ""hardware"" to be cleaned.<br /><br />It doesn't fit your hand. When you're slick with soap the plastic shell makes it hard to hold onto. It's useless for building lather, even with our soft water. Both sides are too small. Because of the shell, you can't run it between your toes, nor use it even on ground-in dirt between your fingers.<br /><br />And I'll try to be as delicate as I can here-- For washing male ""private parts,"" it's impossible. Both front and back.<br /><br />My wife's normal pink ""poof"" is far better.<br /><br />Put it in packaging you might see in an auto parts store, and label it a ""tool.""

I told them they could try it, but that it would be spicy. They agreed, took the small bites I gave them and continued to ask for more until the entire package was gone! The flavor is exactly as the title describes. It's sweet and spicy, and reminds me of a dish I would order at a Thai restaurant. It's not as Spicy as the Sweet N Hot, but it still has quite a kick. It's not my favorite flavor, but I still give it 5 stars for the great texture and good flavor (and the fact that my kids devoured it). I bought this package with my kids in mind.

5,Best bulk rate,These pouches have a tendency to be quite expensive if you go to places like Petco or small boutiques. Our cats personally like all of the flavors that these Wellness pouches come in but we try to order the grain free ones. We don't give them the whole pouch at once and even when they stay in the pouch they don't get as crusted over and stale as when they are in the can. Feeding your cats on the pouches alone however can become rather expensive and we normally supplement the pouches with dry food.,Positive,pouch tendency quite expensive go place like petco small boutique cat personally like flavor wellness pouch come try order grain free one dont give whole pouch even stay pouch dont get crusted stale feeding cat pouch alone however become rather expensive normally supplement pouch dry food

2,"Good at first, but quickly became overbearing for me","I bought this tea at my health food store because I thought it looked interesting. The name and the description really pulled me in, as well as the picture on the box. At first I was confused as to what the taste reminded me of, but then I realized it reminded me of pink Necco mints. I don't drink sugar in tea, but I think if I did and I had put some in this tea it would've made it overbearing. However, after drinking this tea once every day for a week or so, I'm finding it to be almost like a chore. I love the health benefits and this tea has actually helped me feel pretty good after drinking a cup, but the taste is becoming a bit overbearing. As I mentioned early in my review, the taste is reminiscent of pink Necco mints (minus the mint part, of course) but it can be hard for me to get through a cup of it because after awhile that Necco taste begins to remind me more and more of chalk. Yes, it definitely has a chalky flavor. I will still continue to drink this tea until the box is gone but I don't think I'll be buying any more of it unless it has some sort of miraculous effect on me later on down the box.

5,Instantly gets my dog to eat his food!,"My dog (GSD - 2 years) is an extremely picky eater.  He likes the TOTW DRY dog food, but he only eats it when he feels like it.  Sometimes he will only eat every other day.  I started adding TOTW CANNED dog food (the same kind as the dry) to his kibble and he LOVES it.  Instead of just sniffing the food and walking away, he instantly eats it as soon as I put the bowl down.  I have read that canned dog food is much better than the dry kibble because there is less chemicals and although a meal consisting of only canned food could be pretty pretty expensive with a big dog like mine, adding the canned food into his dry allows him to get the benefits of the canned food, makes him eat more consistently, and even ends up saving you money.  Great product.",Positive,dog gsd year extremely picky eater like totw dry dog food eats feel like sometimes eat every day started adding totw canned dog food kind dry kibble love instead sniffing food walking away instantly eats soon put bowl read canned dog food much better dry kibble less chemical although meal consisting canned food could pretty pretty expensive big dog like mine adding canned food dry allows get benefit canned food make eat consistently even end saving money great product

5,Hibiscus Flowers,"Researchers in Taiwan have found that an extract of hibiscus flower contains some of the same health-giving compounds as red wine and tea. Many folk medicine traditions use the hibiscus flower to treat high blood pressure and liver problems."" ~Susan Aldridge, PhD, medical journalist<br /><br />The day after happening upon the idea of blending brewed and cooled Passion Herbal Infusion with orange juice, I found the lovely Tazo Iced Tea Collection. They have a recipe for Passion Lemonade and a Passion Tea Smoothie. I'm happy to blend orange juice, a packet of stevia and cooled brewed Passion tea. The taste is surprisingly good.<br /><br />Ingredients: Hibiscus flowers, natural tropical flavors, citric acid, orange peel, licorice root, cinnamon bark, rose hips. Lemongrass and red poppy.<br /><br />The deep purple/red color and hibiscus fragrance is enough to make anyone passionate about tea. Yet, is this really tea? It looks like tea, but it is really an herbal infusion made by steeping hibiscus flowers, orange peel, licorice, cinnamon, rose hips, lemongrass and red poppy in a swirling of hot water.<br /><br />The flavor is slightly reminiscent of hot apple cider or hot cranberry juice. This tea leaves a tingle on your tongue and I think it goes very well with a spoonful of honey.<br /><br />I do think you need two tea bags for each experience, so as to fully intoxicate the senses and experience the magic of the ingredients.<br /><br />Caffeine Free. Since the scent of orange reduces anxiety and hibiscus blossoms are said to lower blood pressure, this tea is a wonderful calming blend.<br /><br />NOTE: Many of my health/herb books say hibiscus flowers are not recommended during pregnancy.

5,"Yes, it's expensive but...","SO WORTH IT.  And when you do the math, it's actually a bargain.  More on that later....<br /><br />Some background:  My dog is an 80 pound American Pit Bull Terrier.  He is the love of my life (ok, he's a tie with my husband).  He has horrible allergies, both environmental and food.  Because of this, his doggie dermatologist (yep, there's dermatologists out there just for animals!) has him on an elimination diet of just venison.  Being that I completely spoil my dog I've been looking for high quality venison treats to feed him when I stumbled upon the ZiwiPeak venison on Amazon.  I'd not heard of ZiwiPeak, but when I looked at how few ingredients were in there and did a little research, I decided it sounded about as close to bambi in a bag as I could get (sorry, I know that's a sad visual...).  So, I ordered a few bags of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats.  Titan went mad for them.  It was as if I was sprinkling him with magical venison fairy dust and he would do anything so long as I would continue to shower him with those heavenly venison squares.<br /><br />Titan suffers from a tiny case of separation anxiety, so recently when I had to leave him alone for a while and I was fresh out of bambi bones, I put a handful on top of his food and tip toed towards the door.  He barely lifted his head from the bowl.  For insurance, I threw a half empty bag of the ZiwiPeak Venison treats on the floor just as I slipped out the door...he noticed the bag, but kept eating from his bowl, pushing it around and digging through the kibble with his nose to sniff out the ZiwiPeak squares as if a pig searching for truffles in the south of France.  When I returned a couple of hours later, I searched the house for evidence that he wasn't pleased with my departure.  Apart from the garbage being knocked over (my fault for leaving it full, bad mom!) the place was fine.<br /><br />Later when I went to put down his dinner, Titan sat at the entrance of the kitchen and stared at the cabinet where the venison treats were kept.  When I told him to go and eat, he stayed put, staring at the cabinet.  I added a little canned venison to entice him.  No go.  Finally I poured a little bit of the ZiwiPeak Venison on top and he ran to his bowl and started eating.  Now, he will not go near the bowl unless there is a hefty portion of ZP in there.  Figuring I could save some money, I moved up from the treats to the 2.2 pound bag.  Once I went through that in a week, I moved on to the 11 pound bag.  I haven't made the complete transition to just ZP in his bowl, as I'm still mixing it in with his old stuff, but it's just a matter of time.  The vet has had Titan on one of those vet prescribed diets, which, when I looked at the ingredients on that bag, not only could I not pronounce most of them, but the list was HUGE and the first ingredient was POTATO!<br /><br />But back to my point:  I've bought venison treats for Titan that were anywhere from $10 for 5 or 6 ounces, (which translates to $30 per pound) to $44 per pound for venison jerky (and I paid it!!).  So, at $9 a pound, the ZiwiPeak Venison is actually a bargain.  And, it is a lot of food packed into those tiny squares.  Not to mention, you know how sometimes your dog eats a bowl of food and then throws up and the vomit looks like a mixture of spongy kibble and foam?  Titan's never had that with this stuff.  I think it's because the ZP is so close to the natural thing that there isn't anything in there to cause it to expand which then causes him to throw up.<br /><br />So yes, overall, I'm very happy with the product line.  I think it's a pretty cool thing that I can use his food as treats and he still goes mad for it (much like a toddler with cheerios!).  I'll be experimenting with some of the other varieties once I'm allowed to introduce other foods per the doggie dermatologist; and I will be trying out the ZP canned as well.",Positive,worth math actually bargain latersome background dog pound american pit bull terrier love life ok he tie husband horrible allergy environmental food doggie dermatologist yep there dermatologist animal elimination diet venison completely spoil dog ive looking high quality venison treat feed stumbled upon ziwipeak venison amazon id heard ziwipeak looked ingredient little research decided sounded close bambi bag could get sorry know thats sad visual ordered bag ziwipeak venison treat titan went mad sprinkling magical venison fairy dust would anything long would continue shower heavenly venison squarestitan suffers tiny case separation anxiety recently leave alone fresh bambi bone put handful top food tip toed towards door barely lifted head bowl insurance threw half empty bag ziwipeak venison treat floor slipped doorhe noticed bag kept eating bowl pushing around digging kibble nose sniff ziwipeak square pig searching truffle south france returned couple hour later searched house evidence wasnt pleased departure apart garbage knocked fault leaving full bad mom place finelater went put dinner titan sat entrance kitchen stared cabinet venison treat kept told go eat stayed put staring cabinet added little canned venison entice go finally poured little bit ziwipeak venison top ran bowl started eating go near bowl unless hefty portion zp figuring could save money moved treat pound bag went week moved pound bag havent made complete transition zp bowl im still mixing old stuff matter time vet titan one vet prescribed diet looked ingredient bag could pronounce list huge first ingredient potatobut back point ive bought venison treat titan anywhere ounce translates per pound per pound venison jerky paid pound ziwipeak venison actually bargain lot food packed tiny square mention know sometimes dog eats bowl food throw vomit look like mixture spongy kibble foam titan never stuff think zp close natural thing isnt anything cause expand cause throw upso yes overall im happy product line think pretty cool thing use food treat still go mad much like toddler cheerio ill experimenting variety im allowed introduce food per doggie dermatologist trying zp canned well

4,Best K-cup cocoa,"I've tried all the available brands and flavors of hot cocoa for the Keurig, and this is the only one I keep buying more of when I run out. Of course it's not going to be as good as melting your own chocolate in a pot of fresh milk, but I find it at least as tasty as any non-K-cup cocoa mix I've had. It is richer than the same company's milk-chocolate cocoa (which would, however, be my #2 pick of K-cup cocoas).<br /><br />One star off because of the fact that if you prepare a small cup, there will usually be some cocoa goop left behind in the K-cup, which you have to move to your mug if you want maximum-strength cocoa. Shaking the K-cup first to break up large chunks of powder as recommended on the package seems to help some.",Positive,ive tried available brand flavor hot cocoa keurig one keep buying run course going good melting chocolate pot fresh milk find least tasty nonkcup cocoa mix ive richer company milkchocolate cocoa would however pick kcup cocoasone star fact prepare small cup usually cocoa goop left behind kcup move mug want maximumstrength cocoa shaking kcup first break large chunk powder recommended package seems help

Also if you are used to a very sweet sauce, this is not for you. But if you like real authentic marinara, absolutely this is the right product. The spices are balanced and the tomatoes have the right mix of acid, sweetness and tomato flavor. Look at the ingredient list - everything is natural, no weird chemicals or preservatives. Plus the aseptic cartons will keep almost forever. One carton is more than enough for two adults and one child who loves pasta, for one meal. So one case is going to keep us in spaghetti, lasagna, manicotti, stuffed shells, etc. for a long time and the cost point was great, taking into account the free shipping. This is just a fantastic food product and I wish I'd tried it sooner.",Positive,prepared marinara sauce ive ever approach make home discernable chunk tomato carrot etc sauce one people prefer completely smooth sauce also used sweet sauce like real authentic marinara absolutely right product spice balanced tomato right mix acid sweetness tomato flavor look ingredient list everything natural weird chemical preservative plus aseptic carton keep almost forever one carton enough two adult one child love pasta one meal one case going keep u spaghetti lasagna manicotti stuffed shell etc long time cost point great taking account free shipping fantastic food product wish id tried sooner
2,coconut oil disappointment,"The product is not quite what I expected based on the reviews and hype offered.  If it has even a hint of coconut flavor, it eludes me.

Great healthy ingredients -- besides being grain free which is all I'll buy, I love the lack of additives or dubious ingredients.

2,2 stars only for the name,"My cats like Fancy Feast no doubt and I got a good price on this product.  However, the down side... the cats are not crazy about this flavor and one of them throws up from it and they do not throw up from any other foods.  I put it side by side with the Fancy Feast poultry and they gobble that up with no getting sick.  For whatever reason the Filet Mignon flavor is just not a hit with them and it is also from my perspective in comparison to other selections it doesn't smell good either.<br /><br />I am only giving two stars over one because I do tend to like the Fancy Feast name and so do my cats.  Another cat might like this flavor just fine but my crew does not.",Negative,cat like fancy feast doubt got good price product however side cat crazy flavor one throw throw food put side side fancy feast poultry gobble getting sick whatever reason filet mignon flavor hit also perspective comparison selection doesnt smell good eitheri giving two star one tend like fancy feast name cat another cat might like flavor fine crew
3,"Not As Balanced As Other Bold Flavors, But Not Bad","I went out on a limb trying Blue Diamond Almonds Bold - Wasabi & Soy flavor.  I had never had wasabi before, but I have like many of the other ""Bold"" flavors Blue Diamond makes (Jalapeno Smokehouse and Habanero BBQ) so I decided to give them a try.  The flavor is definitely bold.  It reminds me of the horseradish flavor that is common in many deli mustards.  It has grown on me over time, but I would like to see a little more balance with the ""soy"" flavor.  This is where I like the other flavors that I mentioned better as I think these are bold but better balanced.  If you love wasabi or horseradish, this will probably be right up your alley.  Combine that with almonds being one of the healthier snack options, and you've good a good treat.  Much like the other flavors, the bold flavor makes moderation fairly easy as I could not imagine going overboard on these.  Enjoy!",Neutral,went limb trying blue diamond almond bold wasabi soy flavor never wasabi like many bold flavor blue diamond make jalapeno smokehouse habanero bbq decided give try flavor definitely bold reminds horseradish flavor common many deli mustard grown time would like see little balance soy flavor like flavor mentioned better think bold better balanced love wasabi horseradish probably right alley combine almond one healthier snack option youve good good treat much like flavor bold flavor make moderation fairly easy could imagine going overboard enjoy

2,Lickin it all night long,"My dogs seem to find Likety Stik extremely tasty as demonstrated by their desire to keep licking it. On my part, however, there are some reservations.  I have the liver flavor and for one, it is one of the worst smelling doggie treats that I have.  Not too sure if people want to carry this around in their purse. The stick works like a rollerball, like some of the anitperspirants you see out on market.  When you first open, it does not roll very easily, but eventually it will get going after your dog licks it a few times.  The second major reservation that I have is that if it is being licked, then the part my dog just licked cleaned, saliva and all, goes back into the fluid reservoir which doesn't seem too clean to me. Some may argue that this shouldn't make any difference to my dog who loves licking his hooha and whose favorite appetizer is cat poop, but I cannot help to think that this may be a festering ground for bacteria.  This may be prevented by having certain chemicals present that inhibit this possibility, but then it loops back to my concern of feeding these to my dog.  Although novel, I don't really see a benefit of having this as a treat other than the caloric count.",Negative,dog seem find likety stik extremely tasty demonstrated desire keep licking part however reservation liver flavor one one worst smelling doggie treat sure people want carry around purse stick work like rollerball like anitperspirants see market first open roll easily eventually get going dog lick time second major reservation licked part dog licked cleaned saliva go back fluid reservoir doesnt seem clean may argue shouldnt make difference dog love licking hooha whose favorite appetizer cat poop help think may festering ground bacteria may prevented certain chemical present inhibit possibility loop back concern feeding dog although novel dont really see benefit treat caloric count

As somebody who is well aware of the importance of water and drinks upwards to 2-3 gallons a day when I am training, this water puts the life back into my body and allows me to push it to new levels. The graphics on it are exceptional and when I am drinking it out in public I always get asked ""what is Trivedi Water"" and I am never short of energy to explain it.<br /><br />Thanks Mr. Trivedi for your hardwork and efforts in all that you do.

4,For when I'm going decaf,I like the flavor of this tea.  It is not subtle in any way.  The lemon coupled with ginger provides a very drinkable and somewhat stomach soothing combination.

4,Japanese Style Noodles (Sapporo Ichiban),"These aren't bad noodles, but they're certainly not the greatest. In all honesty, they taste almost exactly like Maruchan's beef flavoured noodles, but a tad bit better. Unlike Shin noodles, it has a lot less sodium in it, for those who have heart trouble. It has roughly half the sodium that Shin has, (Shin having between 30-50% depending on the flavour you get).<br /><br />If you interested in trying some different kind of noodles for some reason or another, then I would recommend trying this.",Positive,arent bad noodle theyre certainly greatest honesty taste almost exactly like maruchans beef flavoured noodle tad bit better unlike shin noodle lot less sodium heart trouble roughly half sodium shin shin depending flavour getif interested trying different kind noodle reason another would recommend trying
4,Almost a 5,"I love the can size. I can use one per day rather than covering and refrigerating for the next day.  It is great because this food is supposed to go to the cat at room temperature.  Unfortunately,  I believe I checked when I was considering changing to these smaller cans and found that they are more expensive for the amount my cat eats per day than the larger cans.  The only reason I don't give this product a 5 can be remedied by either Newman's Own or Amazon.  I am a prime member but since subscribe and save does not use prime I have to double order.  There are 24 cans so prime once a month (regular shipping time vs. 2 day prime makes it longer than once a month) won't keep my cat feed for the month.  I don't understand why subscribe and save does not honor prime membership.  When customers choose subscribe and save they are giving Amazon long-term consistent business. I guess if Newman's Own packed 40 or 48 cans it would work better with subscribe and save.",Positive,love size use one per day rather covering refrigerating next day great food supposed go cat room temperature unfortunately believe checked considering changing smaller can found expensive amount cat eats per day larger can reason dont give product remedied either newman amazon prime member since subscribe save use prime double order can prime month regular shipping time v day prime make longer month wont keep cat feed month dont understand subscribe save honor prime membership customer choose subscribe save giving amazon longterm consistent business guess newman packed can would work better subscribe save

4,"A sweet, refreshing drink!","I've never been much of a soda drinker, so I'm always on the lookout for alternative beverages like juice and tea.  Lately, I've been swept up in the craze of coconut water.  When I saw this bottle of 'aloe water' I immediately wondered what the new flavor was.<br /><br />When I opened the bottle, I was reminded of the smell of apple juice.  Aloe Gloe has a very sweet, crisp flavor.  Considering there is a both cane sugar AND Stevia sweetening up this drink, I guess that isn't a surprise.  It's very pleasant and enjoyable, and would be extremely refreshing chilled and served on a hot summer's day.<br /><br />One odd note, though: if you drink directly from the bottle, there's a distinctive plastic  note to the liquid.  That was rather disconcerting.  I think that if you drink it from a glass this would probably be alleviated.",Positive,ive never much soda drinker im always lookout alternative beverage like juice tea lately ive swept craze coconut water saw bottle aloe water immediately wondered new flavor waswhen opened bottle reminded smell apple juice aloe gloe sweet crisp flavor considering cane sugar stevia sweetening drink guess isnt surprise pleasant enjoyable would extremely refreshing chilled served hot summer dayone odd note though drink directly bottle there distinctive plastic note liquid rather disconcerting think drink glass would probably alleviated

5,Toffee!,"Now, I have to say, I am wildly impressed with Red Leaf Tea. With the sheer amount of matcha I've been getting through this promotion, I was starting to feel like I was taking advantage of their goodwill and resolved to hang up my reviewing hat, saying that I had tried all the flavors I wanted to try. Imagine my pleased surprise when I mentioned this in a review and they responded to let me know they were releasing new flavors soon and encouraging me to keep trying new ones and keep reviewing! I know they read all reviews posted and I've received wonderfully kind responses to my reviews and emails to them. Their customer service is stellar and it makes it so that I want to recommend their teas to everyone I meet (and I do!). And while yes, I have gotten a ton of matcha through this promotion, I've also gained an adoration of matcha that will keep me coming to them long after I really do stop reviewing their product. But by now they know me, and they know my reviews and they're just wonderfully kind to me. When I received my package yesterday, I found a little matcha spoon included with my order! I don't know if it's a promotion I just didn't see, or if it was for me specially, but it certainly made my day!<br /><br />I don't know an awful lot about English toffee, but what I do know, I like. I got this one to try with my wife, in an effort to get her to like matcha. We'll see how it goes!<br /><br />When I opened the package, it smelled a lot like the Caramel Matcha from Red Leaf Tea, which is very promising. I love their Caramel matcha. Brewed up, it still smelled like caramel, but with a hint of chocolate. And that's exactly what it tastes like, caramel mixed together with tasty, tasty chocolate. I'm not a huge chocolate fan, but this is very, very good. Very sweet too, but not overwhelmingly so. But then again, I like my teas sweet. But when I see pictures of English Toffee, this is what I think it would taste like, so yay! I love that it even tastes like that crunchy caramel....mmm.

5,Good with coffee,"These appear to be, on first glance, similar to Nutter Butters.  On taste, however, they are lighter, more delicate, and infused with hazelnut.

4,Too many oranges!,"I had been buying this candy from a machine (for a quarter at a time) and filling a ziplock bag to take home.  I tried to find it in the bricks and mortar stores, and they don't seem to have it or even know what I am talking about.  I even checked the bulk candy place in the mall (which seems to have gotten very expensive), yet even they didn't seem to know.<br /><br />Nitwitz works well as a ""candy dish"" candy because the pieces are solid (no candy dust) and don't seem to leave a residue in the dish (like a gummy candy might).  These are very similar to Willy Wonka Runts, but somewhat smaller and more tart.  The only issue with it is that it seems that the oranges make up an outsize percentage of the mix.  I suppose that it is possible that buying it from the machine somehow filtered out the larger orange pieces.  Also, the orange pieces are more like jawbreakers and I will have to warn guests about trying to bite down on them right away.  The other pieces are not quite as hard.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with the 2.5 lbs. mix and it should last me for several months.  It arrived in an unlabeled, sealed plastic bag inside two padded envelopes.

I have made cakes, pies, cookies, scones, pizza, cornbread, cobblers, and of course, pancakes and waffles.

The two work beautifully together.<br /><br />Here's my issue. I have a standing order with Amazon to ship this product in bulk once every six months. I have found that I need it every four months. Amazon does not offer that option. It gives me the options of 1,2,3, or 6 months.

5,These soynuts are exactly what I wanted,"Roasted, unsalted soy nuts are not the most delicious snack. So before you buy 12, 9 oz packages, you should try a small quantity at your local health food store or asian grocer.

5,That's a tasty little sucker!,"Don't be fooled by appearances--the chocolate taste on these nuts is very subtle. They look to be coated in melted chocolate, but it's more of a delicate dusting, so if you're looking for chocolate-coated candy, look elsewhere. However, if you're looking for a lighter, nutty pick-me-up, you can't go wrong with these.

3,"Smokey, but not what I'd hoped.","I ordered based on the reviews, and while it is better than the likes of most coffees, I'm not really impressed.  I think I'll try Kick Ass next.  Being this coffee is at the highest roast temp, I assumed it would be very smokey, but I find that the Diedrich French Roast is more smokey and more smooth.  The beans did not seem as dark as I expected them to be.  They look more of a typical dark roast, below a French or Italian roast.  Who knows, maybe I'll like Kick Ass better.  And BTW, Diedrich is much cheaper ($9 for 12 oz).",Neutral,ordered based review better like coffee im really impressed think ill try kick as next coffee highest roast temp assumed would smokey find diedrich french roast smokey smooth bean seem dark expected look typical dark roast french italian roast know maybe ill like kick as better btw diedrich much cheaper oz

3,I only see 3 stars tonight...,"I found the reviews on here to be completely misleading.<br /><br />Let me put this simply...<br /><br />This jerky is mediocre at best. The meat is very moist and has a lot of flavor but is overly sweet and salty, almost as if they drenched this in syrup and soy sauce before cooking it. The name Spicy Country should be changed to Mild Country. The slices are too thick and look like boba straws. I also wouldn't recommend it if you prefer your jerky a little more chewier.<br /><br />Positive side: $15 for jerky might be steep but 8 oz is a lot and it's definitely worth the price.<br /><br />It's good jerky, but not the best.<br /><br />If you're looking for some good jerky. Try Jack Links Peppered. It's one of the best jerky's I've had and it's available at your local grocery store.<br /><br />If you're ever in Gilroy, CA, visit the Garlic Shoppe.

When I decided to switch foods, I did alot of research on what good, healthy, mostly organic food to switch them to. I chose Newman's Own, not because I could purchase it easily at a local store .. because I can not do so, I have to order it and have it delivered, but because of the ingredients, how it is made, and because most of the proceeds go to charities.

This tastes so good that we've stopped buying regular ketchup and keep this in the fridge now instead since the kids can't tell the difference anyway.<br /><br />This is an item that might be available locally at your big box retailers, if so you can probably find it for less there.

2,VERY stinky but my dogs LOVED it,"This is a really fun idea! It is a fun treat to give them, and my dogs REALLY like it. The reason why I am giving it a low rating, is because it stinks, really bad! The smell is so offensive that my boyfriend won't let me feed this treat to my dogs while he's around. If my dogs didn't love the taste, and if it wasn't so much fun to feed to them, it would be in the garbage. I won't be buying it again, and don't recommend it. However, if you ever find it on sale or find a free sample or something, it is kind of a fun thing to try ONCE.

4,Pretty Good - I recommend,"I'm currently having a cup of this coffee right now at the breakfast table before eating (on a relaxed Saturday morning when I can take my time and really enjoy this meal with my wife.)  Before having this cup, I just finished a cup of Hawaiian coffee that was good but wasn't Kona.  This cup was too mild and smooth for my tastes.  I grind all of my coffee beans at home.  I like to have one cup of caffeinated coffee first and then follow this with one cup of decaffeinated coffee every morining.  The caffeinated coffees that I like include Kirkland's Guatemala and Ruwanda and Starbucks French Roast.  I like strong, bold flavorful coffee.  I also like Trader Joe's Seattle Blend and another very dark French roast that they sell.  I like Kirkland's decaff a little better than the decaff that Trader Joe's sells.  I have tried Trader Joe's Italian Roast decaff and liked it.  In general, I feel that decaffineated coffees are somewhat one dimensional in taste.  They have a good flavor, but it just isn't bold enough to suite me.  But, for a person who wants to limit their caffeine intake, both Kirkland's and Trader Joe's brands are pretty good and I recommend them.<br /><br />After grinding my own Starbucks French Roast for about two years now, I cannot drink Folgers or Maxwell House by themselves anymore.  I used to love their darker coffees but now find that they just don't have enough flavor to suit me anymore.  I use two rounded tablespoons of freshly ground coffee and filtered tap water to make my coffee.  On weekends, I use a french press to get a little more flavor out of that first cup of coffee.  Obviously, I'm not an expert on coffees but I know what I like and Kirkland's decaff is pretty good.  Of the caffeinated, I got tired of Starbucks French Roast after a while.  I like the the Guatemala a lot.  I want to try the Mayorca brand soon.",Positive,im currently cup coffee right breakfast table eating relaxed saturday morning take time really enjoy meal wife cup finished cup hawaiian coffee good wasnt kona cup mild smooth taste grind coffee bean home like one cup caffeinated coffee first follow one cup decaffeinated coffee every morining caffeinated coffee like include kirklands guatemala ruwanda starbucks french roast like strong bold flavorful coffee also like trader joes seattle blend another dark french roast sell like kirklands decaff little better decaff trader joes sell tried trader joes italian roast decaff liked general feel decaffineated coffee somewhat one dimensional taste good flavor isnt bold enough suite person want limit caffeine intake kirklands trader joes brand pretty good recommend themafter grinding starbucks french roast two year drink folgers maxwell house anymore used love darker coffee find dont enough flavor suit anymore use two rounded tablespoon freshly ground coffee filtered tap water make coffee weekend use french press get little flavor first cup coffee obviously im expert coffee know like kirklands decaff pretty good caffeinated got tired starbucks french roast like guatemala lot want try mayorca brand soon

4,tasty granola bar,"Kellogg's Special K Dark Chocolate granola bars are tasty, however they are pretty generic. Nothing really stood out and wowed me, however they do taste good in my opinion. The dark chocolate is probably the best part of it. When I first bit into it, it reminded me of a rice krispie treat with chocolate. Instead of rice cereal though, it is made with oats. The box comes with 5 bars so with the price on Amazon, it costs about 75 cents a bar. Each bar contains 110 calories, 4 grams of fiber, 4 grams of protein, 3 grams of total fat, 85 mg of sodium, and 7 grams of sugar. They are pretty sweet so if you aren't a big sweets fan you probably won't like these. It's almost as sweet as a candy bar in my opinion, so it would be a healthier choice if given the option between the two.<br /><br />Overall, they are decent. I'd buy them myself if they were on sale at the grocery store.",Positive,kellogg special k dark chocolate granola bar tasty however pretty generic nothing really stood wowed however taste good opinion dark chocolate probably best part first bit reminded rice krispie treat chocolate instead rice cereal though made oat box come bar price amazon cost cent bar bar contains calorie gram fiber gram protein gram total fat mg sodium gram sugar pretty sweet arent big sweet fan probably wont like almost sweet candy bar opinion would healthier choice given option twooverall decent id buy sale grocery store

My Brussels was a 1 year old rescue dog and he wouldn't eat the Iams dog food we had so I researched food and found this one. I decided to give it a try. My golden went blind less then a year ago and gained a lot of weight(it's one of the side effects of his disease SARDS) so I wanted to see if this would help at all.... Well guess what! My golden has lost weight and his coat looks healthier after 1 month 1/2 of eating the food and my Brussels loves it too. I highly recommend this food! On a side note we watched my in-laws 14 year old dog and she hardly eats her wet pedigree dog food.

4,A very good sampler if you are giving a Keurig as a gift,"It's hard for me the believe this myself but so far I have given 8 Keurig coffee makers away (five model B40s, two B60s and two B70s) as gifts and I always give this sampler to go along with the k-cups included with the machine.  I feel that it includes a very good selection of coffees and teas.  If someone does not like a particular beverage (some people NEVER drink tea for instance) the recipients have found that they can keep them on hand for guests.  This does not include all of my favorites but it does have a very good mix.  Here are some of the most popular:<br /><br />Hazelnut:  I don't know why but most of the women in my family (and many  of the men) LOVE this one.<br />Rain Forest Espresso:  If a person likes a full bodied coffee then this could be the one for them.<br />Breakfast Blend:  A milder, medium blend that a lot of people enjoy.<br />Chinese Green Tea:  This is becoming more and more popular in the US and my friends who drink tea like this K-Cup.<br />English Breakfast Tea:  A classic.<br /><br />And the not-so-popular ones:<br /><br />Italian Hot Lemon Beverage:  I have personally never met someone who liked this one.  I am sure that someone does, just no one that I know.<br />Italian Blend:  I usually like an Italian coffee but this one is not popular with my friends, family and guests for some reason.<br /><br />There are others in this pack but in my experience these are the ones that the people in my life usually love and the ones that they avoid.",Positive,hard believe far given keurig coffee maker away five model b two b two b gift always give sampler go along kcups included machine feel includes good selection coffee tea someone like particular beverage people never drink tea instance recipient found keep hand guest include favorite good mix popularhazelnut dont know woman family many men love onerain forest espresso person like full bodied coffee could one thembreakfast blend milder medium blend lot people enjoychinese green tea becoming popular u friend drink tea like kcupenglish breakfast tea classicand notsopopular onesitalian hot lemon beverage personally never met someone liked one sure someone one knowitalian blend usually like italian coffee one popular friend family guest reasonthere others pack experience one people life usually love one avoid
5,Aboslutely wonderful for my pitbull,"I ordered this after reading a ton of awesome reviews and in hopes that it may hope with my dog, Kitty, a 65 pound, 2 year-old pit bull's recent issues with her skin. It turns out that her problem was in fact due to corn and other fillers used in lesser quality dog foods (in this case, Purina One). Overall, this product alone made it completely worth the cost to subscribe to Amazon Prime for the extremely fast and cheap shipping, so for less money (as Kitty now requires less food, since she's more full from eating less of the higher quality food and we make sure to only feed her what the vet recommends,) I no longer have to drive to the store and pick up a 40 pound bag of dog food and load it into the back of one of my GTIs. So far, Kitty's been gaining weight and muscle at a pretty decent rate, in my opinion. (Over the past 2 months, she's gone from approximately 59 pounds to 67.5 pounds currently, and is quite fit and happy.) All this, is of course in addition to daily exercise, walks, et cetera, but her temperament lately has also been much better. On the lesser quality dog chow, she used to mope around the house every few days, but lately, she's been very happy, energetic and outgoing. She seems to be much less easily stressed out, which is great for her, as she tend to be a bit anxious, although an absolute sweetheart.<br /><br />Bottom Line: I could not recommend this or any other Canidae Dog Food product highly enough. By word of mouth at work alone, I've converted over ten people since switching at the beginning of the year (2011).",Positive,ordered reading ton awesome review hope may hope dog kitty pound yearold pit bull recent issue skin turn problem fact due corn filler used lesser quality dog food case purina one overall product alone made completely worth cost subscribe amazon prime extremely fast cheap shipping less money kitty requires less food since shes full eating less higher quality food make sure feed vet recommends longer drive store pick pound bag dog food load back one gtis far kitty gaining weight muscle pretty decent rate opinion past month shes gone approximately pound pound currently quite fit happy course addition daily exercise walk et cetera temperament lately also much better lesser quality dog chow used mope around house every day lately shes happy energetic outgoing seems much less easily stressed great tend bit anxious although absolute sweetheartbottom line could recommend canidae dog food product highly enough word mouth work alone ive converted ten people since switching beginning year

3,Disappointing,"My dog is being treated for a condition that requires me to reduce her exercise level to almost nothing.  I'm desperately trying to find treats that will keep her quiet and aren't rawhide.  The vet told me I shouldn't give me dog rawhide on a daily basis, so I decided to try these edible Nylabones.<br /><br />My dog loved how these tasted, but she finished them in a matter of minutes.  The description calls these ""edible chews,"" so I was expecting these bones to keep my dog occupied.  I wouldn't call these bones ""chewy"" either.  They seem to be slightly tougher than a Milkbone, but just as dry.  I have been a fan of Nylabone products for as long as I can remember.  I raised all my puppies with Nylabones, but these edible Nylabones don't last long enough.<br /><br />On the plus side, my dog did enjoy these treats and they didn't give her an upset stomach (she has a pretty tough stomach though).",Neutral,dog treated condition requires reduce exercise level almost nothing im desperately trying find treat keep quiet arent rawhide vet told shouldnt give dog rawhide daily basis decided try edible nylabonesmy dog loved tasted finished matter minute description call edible chew expecting bone keep dog occupied wouldnt call bone chewy either seem slightly tougher milkbone dry fan nylabone product long remember raised puppy nylabones edible nylabones dont last long enoughon plus side dog enjoy treat didnt give upset stomach pretty tough stomach though

But in the afternoon, sometimes one of us wants a cup and it is not worthwhile to brew another pot or grind up the beans to make a smaller pot. That's what we have our Senseo for. We keep a couple different kinds of pods around to suit various tastes, and this one suits mine.<br /><br />These are a little stronger, and more full-bodied than the basic medium roast Senseo pods, yet the flavor is not quite as acidic as their dark roast pods. I use one pod for a ""double"" serving (the button with the 2 cups), which is (I know) not the recommended way, but I still seem to get good results. If I happen to be making one first thing in the morning and need a little more strength, I will use 2 pods and press the double first, and then the single to get a slightly larger and stronger cup.",Positive,normally brew full pot coffee home morning enough coffee drinker make worthwhile afternoon sometimes one u want cup worthwhile brew another pot grind bean make smaller pot thats senseo keep couple different kind pod around suit various taste one suit minethese little stronger fullbodied basic medium roast senseo pod yet flavor quite acidic dark roast pod use one pod double serving button cup know recommended way still seem get good result happen making one first thing morning need little strength use pod press double first single get slightly larger stronger cup
4,The best decaf black tea out there,"Caffeine can often be a problem for me and I often like to have a comforting cup of tea in the evening.  I have tried most of the decaffeinated black teas out there and most are poor quality and/or very weak.  I'm not overly fond of herbal ""teas,"" Earl Grey or green teas and this is the best decaffeinated black tea I've found, at least readily available in the States.  Though not as strong as the equivalent caffeinated Twinings version, it is pretty close and has a lovely full-bodied flavor without bitterness.  If you like your tea on the stronger side, simply allow a minute or so longer steeping time on this one(I tend to drink mine brewed strong with a bit of milk).<br /><br />I admit there are caffeinated black teas (including several loose teas) that I prefer over this one, but based on a lot of searching, this is the best of the decafs and I'm glad it's available for an evening cuppa.

I wasn't surprised that it was a little more expensive than the usual tea bags, but it was WELL WORTH IT.  The Pepperment is subtle and aromatic.

4,Passion Fruit Nectar,"This stuff was really hard to find!  I really like that it is actual fruit and not just juice, water and sugar.  The price was ok, but the shipping makes it a bit less desirable.

4,He likes it (and licks it) but sticky ball,"Our dog really likes this thing.  It smells like it is full of flavor, and he seems to really enjoy licking the thing for as long as I'll hold it for him.  If you are unfamiliar, the flavored juice in the container is released each time the dog licks a small ball at the tops of the container; as the ball spins, it gets covered in the juice, which the dog licks off, etc.  So, well done!  My one beef with the product, though, is that the ball is a little tough to get spinning until it is fully lubricated, which means that I often have to use my fingers to get it started, which isn't ideal because I don't want to get any of the flavored juice on me.  That said, my dog is a big fan of this product.  So, while I think this is a good product, I'm giving it four stars because I think the delivery mechanism (ie the ball) isn't the best, and could be improved upon.",Positive,dog really like thing smell like full flavor seems really enjoy licking thing long ill hold unfamiliar flavored juice container released time dog lick small ball top container ball spin get covered juice dog lick etc well done one beef product though ball little tough get spinning fully lubricated mean often use finger get started isnt ideal dont want get flavored juice said dog big fan product think good product im giving four star think delivery mechanism ie ball isnt best could improved upon
4,"Filling, easy, savory meal for 5","This is an easy-to-make dish that takes macaroni and cheese to the next level.<br /><br />Likes:<br /><br />- Easy prep.  Everything cooks in one pan.  No need to cook noodles separately.  Took 5 minutes to prep and 15 minutes to wait while it simmered.<br />- Makes a lot of food.  Our family of three was stuffed and we still had a lot left over.  This really does make 5 servings.<br />- Flavor is good. This is a comfort food.  The addition of lean ground beef really adds to the flavor.<br />- Nutrition is good if you use extra lean ground beef (except sodium.. see below).<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />- A little high in sodium (38% RDA / 850mg / serving).  This is very common for these sorts of meals.<br /><br />Other thoughts:  If you use 90% lean ground beef, you get 9g fat per serving, which isn't too bad.  We used 95% so had more like 5g fat per serving (estimate).",Positive,easytomake dish take macaroni cheese next levellikes easy prep everything cook one pan need cook noodle separately took minute prep minute wait simmered make lot food family three stuffed still lot left really make serving flavor good comfort food addition lean ground beef really add flavor nutrition good use extra lean ground beef except sodium see belowdislikes little high sodium rda mg serving common sort mealsother thought use lean ground beef get g fat per serving isnt bad used like g fat per serving estimate

5,Toaster Patries a Winner!,"I absolutely love these, my kids love them too, lol. All the flavors are good with the exception of those chocolate ones (but I wasn't a chocolate pop tart fan either- but even them weren't bad just better to us cold, not hot). Either way these are one of the best and from one who could live on pop tarts in less healthier times is more content that this is a much better substitute. Not only are they organic, but they dont contain any artificial ""icks"". Bear in mind these types of foods are not for people who are trying to lose weight. It's not a protein bar it's a toaster pastry. It's good for people on the go, great for kids and those who want a more health conscious snack than their counterpart (not fat free, sugar free, but certainly better) and for parents who have chosen not to give artificially flavored, colored crap this makes me feel good (and their tasty!)<br />btw, if you love these you'll also go for the frosted apple cinnamon and blueberry :-D",Positive,absolutely love kid love lol flavor good exception chocolate one wasnt chocolate pop tart fan either even werent bad better u cold hot either way one best one could live pop tart less healthier time content much better substitute organic dont contain artificial icks bear mind type food people trying lose weight protein bar toaster pastry good people go great kid want health conscious snack counterpart fat free sugar free certainly better parent chosen give artificially flavored colored crap make feel good tastybtw love youll also go frosted apple cinnamon blueberry
4,"A Horse Is a Horse Is a Snack, Of Course","My dog is constantly out to get me. Keeping little miss 'Princess Paws' from rooting through the trash, diddling the carpets or wrecking the house is like trying to keep Lindsey Lohan out of dive bars, crack dens and paparazzi mug shots. In other words -- nearly impossible.<br /><br />But lord help me, I try.<br /><br />I bought a bag of these biscuits, thinking I could coax the mutt into good behavior through 'positive reinforcement'. Though the idea sort of fizzles when the dog is too finicky to eat the stupid things. She gave the tiniest of disinterested exploratory sniffs, then scrunched her furry little schnozz like I was offering her a handful of barf-encrusted crap.<br /><br />(Which, based on her previous dietary choices, she would actually eat. Tasty baked tidbit? No, thanks; I'm trying to keep my greyhoundish figure.<br /><br />The poop du jour in half-digested BLEEEH-rnaise sauce? Mmmm-mmmm! Bon appeturd!)<br /><br />I tried to entice her, but she wasn't having it. I even tried a little nibble myself, to prove I wasn't trying to poison her. (Yet.)<br /><br />And actually, the biscuit was pretty good. It's got a nice crunch, with a taste somewhere between a heavy water cracker and reconstituted horse meal. But pretty light on the 'horse meal' part. All in all, not bad. I'd give it about a four on the people-food scale -- somewhere between a stale bag of Funyuns and a plain rice cake eaten off a sweaty Clydesdale's back. I finished the first one and had another. Pretty soon I'd gone through half the bag.<br /><br />So this was a complete waste for the dog. But I found a new snack for TV nights. Now if I'm out of popcorn, I set out a bowl of biscuits and munch away. They're not gourmet. But they're filling, and I'm getting my recommended daily allowance of hoof meat all in one sitting.

3,Nice change from coffee,"Nice caramel apple flavor (its an artificially sweetened powder that completely dissolves and empties out of the k-cup). This can have a somewhat strong/tart flavor on small cup setting, so i run the same k-cup twice on 'small' cup setting in a large mug to dilute it slightly more to suit my taste.  Quick and convenient hot apple cider with caramel touch for those occasions when you crave apple cider, hot or cold  add ice cubes).<br /><br />***update*** noticed my keurig was spurting during brew cycle but only when using this caramel apple cider k-cup.  After making a cup of cider, i decided to cut the foil open on the top of the k-cup.  I discovered this stuff clumps during brewing inside the bottom of the cup as a sticky ball.  It has done it on the second pack as well, so might be product & not just a bad batch. Might be clogging up the discharge needle in the bottom of the k-cup.  Just to check out what's inside, I cut open a new cup and small amuont of brown and white powder is all there is to this.",Neutral,nice caramel apple flavor artificially sweetened powder completely dissolve empty kcup somewhat strongtart flavor small cup setting run kcup twice small cup setting large mug dilute slightly suit taste quick convenient hot apple cider caramel touch occasion crave apple cider hot cold add ice cubesupdate noticed keurig spurting brew cycle using caramel apple cider kcup making cup cider decided cut foil open top kcup discovered stuff clump brewing inside bottom cup sticky ball done second pack well might product bad batch might clogging discharge needle bottom kcup check whats inside cut open new cup small amuont brown white powder

5,Truly delicious,"This is an amazing brand.  I don't like garlic, and they mostly do sauces without it.  It seems the manufacturers of pasta consider garlic to be a centerpiece of their sauce, but in fact, there is no need to stick it everywhere, and the taste is better without it.  The sauces of this brand are the best I tried.  Furthermore, this sauce tastes very flavorful and authentic Italian, where, unlike in the USA, garlic does not permeate every tomato sauce.",Positive,amazing brand dont like garlic mostly sauce without seems manufacturer pasta consider garlic centerpiece sauce fact need stick everywhere taste better without sauce brand best tried furthermore sauce taste flavorful authentic italian unlike usa garlic permeate every tomato sauce

Coffee is my drink of choice when I need to stay awake during long stretches in the semester, but I frequently study with classmates that don't drink coffee.  Starbucks VIA packets are the PERFECT solution for me.  I don't need to bring a coffee maker and coffee.  I just pack a few packets into my bag and go.  I must say that I was genuinely surprised at how fresh and full this coffee tastes.  Whenever I make a cup, I'm amazed because I never get that instant coffee bitterness/staleness found elsewhere.

One sachet will give a great taste to 1 litre (approximately a 32 oz nalgene sized container) for only 70 calories.

I can't brush her teeth because I've got a chronic pain condition that effects my dexterity. I gave her ""Beggin Strips"" for a treat. After a few months, she stopped wanting the ""Strips"" and only wants the Dentastix. I checked with her Veterinarian and she said they are safe to give her more than 1 or 2 a day.<br /> I was hospitalized 9 years ago for 3 weeks and she stayed with relatives. When we both got home, her bathroom habits were all messed up. To fix things, I started to give her half a Dentastix when she went where she was suppose to. After a couple of weeks, her bathroom habits were corrected. The only problem was now, instead of going to the bathroom 2 to 3 times a day, she either pees a little or defecates the size of a penny whenever she wants a Dentastix.<br /> As far as their effectiveness as a tooth cleaner, she has never needed her teeth cleaned. They are in perfect health. I should know, I was a Dentist before I became ill.<br /> I get them sent every 2 months to make sure the are fresh.

5,Love this stuff!,"This product is a dream come true and I haven't even used it in recipes yet.  I love mixing up a small bowl to go, and eating it with sliced apples as a snack.  It's great on rice cakes with sliced bananas too.  The texture (without all the peanut fat) is obviously not as heavy/oily as peanut butter, so picky kids used to regular peanut butter might not like it.  I find it very satisfying and remnicent enough of peanut butter that it's a treat without the thought of packing on calories and fat as with regular peanut butter.  I also love it in smoothies, which usually require a ton of peanut butter to even perceive the taste of peanut, but not with this... A few teaspoons and a frozen banana with almond milk and you've got a smoothie to die for without the guilt.  I'm definately reordering this product.  I liked the PB2 Chocolate as well, but it's not as versatile as the PB2.  I only tend to use the chocolate one in smoothies, whereas the plain PB2 can be used and just add a little cocoa when you want it.  I also love how easy this stuff is to take when traveling...  Again, LOVE this product.",Positive,product dream come true havent even used recipe yet love mixing small bowl go eating sliced apple snack great rice cake sliced banana texture without peanut fat obviously heavyoily peanut butter picky kid used regular peanut butter might like find satisfying remnicent enough peanut butter treat without thought packing calorie fat regular peanut butter also love smoothy usually require ton peanut butter even perceive taste peanut teaspoon frozen banana almond milk youve got smoothie die without guilt im definately reordering product liked pb chocolate well versatile pb tend use chocolate one smoothy whereas plain pb used add little cocoa want also love easy stuff take traveling love product

5,Amazing customer service,"When I ordered this product, I was too lazy to convert ""3-4 mm"" to inches and consequently discovered the ""Coarse Grinder Salt"" was almost 1/4"" (1/6"" to be exact), way too coarse for my salt grinder.  Shortly after receiving my order from Amazon, I received a courtesy email from the Spice Lab to make sure I was happy with my order.  I replied that actually I was not happy, but the fault was mine because I didn't convert the metric dimensions to English units and consequently didn't realize how coarse the salt would be, which was too coarse for my salt mill.  Two days later I received a package of smaller crystals, no charge.

4,A fairly tasty cheap thrill,"In the past, I have absolutely hated pop tarts. I just couldn't imagine why someone would actually eat them. However, my girlfriend loves them, and things were running a bit tight on the grocery expenses front. I certainly wasn't in a position to start buying Ben and Jerry's. These took the place of such expensive gourmet treats. I figured that $8.53 for 48 of these thingys made it a cheap way to stretch our dollars for a week.<br /><br />I think the Amazon description said assorted flavors. We received strawberry and brown cinnamon. Maybe different shipments have different flavors, but I wasn't going to argue given heir low cost. We received four boxes. Each box has six foil packets. Each packet has two tarts.<br /><br />OK, OK, I actually dug into these before my girlfriend. Properly toasted, they're pretty decent. The pastry shell (I guess I can call it that) was not overally doughy or pasty. The filling tasted the way the box said. A single pack of two is reasonably filling as a dessert.<br /><br />Kids and pop tart afionados would probably give these five stars.

YUCK!!!!  It does not taste like root beer.  Why does Zevia company have to invent their own holistic, all-natural recipe for root beer to create a soda with Stevia, why couldn't Zevia have just bought the exact formula from A&W and used Stevia as the sweetener instead?  That soda would taste great.  Unfortunately, this Zevia soda doesn't taste like normal root bear or even diet root beer.  It has a weak taste that's strange and unfamiliar, followed by the harsh aftertaste bite of the oils and ginger making me worry they're covering a weaker, unpleasant aftertaste from either the stevia or other ingredients in the zevia all-natural formula.  Bleh.  If you want guilt-free soda, but dont care about going all-natural, like I don't care, this is not the soda line for you.

5,"Tastes great, helped increase supply","After only a few cups in a couple days, I began noticing an increase in my supply when pumping. Rather than 1-2 oz or less at a session, I began getting 3-4 oz. I had started taking a fenugreek supplement a few weeks prior, which helped as well. I don't pump a lot--just enough to run errands or let dad help with overnight feedings, but this really improved the quality and speed with which I could pump. Maybe it's the placebo effect, but this along with staying hydrated and eating balanced meals is a winner in my book.<br /><br />As for the taste--it SMELLS stronger of anise than it tastes. I find it mild and pleasantly herbal with a splash of whole milk and a little sugar. I make it two tea bags at a time in a standard Copco travel cup. I can see though why some might find the taste bad--it depends on how strongly you oppose the licorice flavor. (I don't like licorice that much but this was fine.)<br /><br />I think the case deal here on Amazon is probably one of the best around--I haven't found it cheaper locally.",Positive,cup couple day began noticing increase supply pumping rather oz less session began getting oz started taking fenugreek supplement week prior helped well dont pump lotjust enough run errand let dad help overnight feeding really improved quality speed could pump maybe placebo effect along staying hydrated eating balanced meal winner bookas tasteit smell stronger anise taste find mild pleasantly herbal splash whole milk little sugar make two tea bag time standard copco travel cup see though might find taste badit depends strongly oppose licorice flavor dont like licorice much finei think case deal amazon probably one best aroundi havent found cheaper locally

5,My favorite flavor bar none,"Diamond Almonds<br />Almonds are a good source of magnesium. One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about ""bowel tolerance"" or ""happy bowels"" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

5,Work GREAT to snuff out Seattle moles !!,"I tried the black box based on input from a friend who is a golf course greenskeeper. He uses them with great success  to eliminate moles on his golf course. Remove surface dirt from mole mound and dig down into the dirt with a hand shovel to locate the tunnel. Locate the tunnel holes on each side of the hole you have dug out and dig enough dirt  to be able to put 2 black boxes back to back into the hole you have dug. Be sure that the black box opening is even with the tunnel floor and  right up against the mole tunnel hole on each side of the hole you have dug. Set the trap (similar to setting a mouse trap) and put soil loosely over the set traps to keep the light out but don't pack  the soil down. When the little bugger moves through that tunnel,  ZAP .... you got him!!

The single pouches are what I use to take with me to work or camping which cuts down on space AND lets me share with others easier.  Great product at home or on the go for sure.

I was specifically looking for dried bhoot jalokia (ghost) chilis that I could grind myself for a variety of uses. I had never purchased from this company before and was concerned that the peppers would be leathery and not really dry enough for my grinders to work correctly. No worries! These chilis were exactly what I was looking for. They were perfectly dried and I was able to grind them very easily into the different consistencies that I need for my various uses (jerky, salsas, etc.) The peppers are first rate: the flavor is awesome - the perfect intense flavor and incredible heat. It is obvious that they started out with only the finest fresh chilis and dried them to perfection. Not only that, but the delivery was faster than promised and the packaging was excellent as the peppers arrived in perfect condition. There is no question where I will go when I need to replenish my supply. If you need perfectly dried chilis of the highest possible quality, look no farther.

1,Over-fried,I bought this brand as a trial since I am tired of the Pingos.<br /><br />It claims that it is natural. I have no argument on this. But the point is that more than 50% in the bag is over-fried and in brown color. I really suffer eating the over-fried chips. I open some other bags and it looks like the same.

5,This is really meant for topical use more than a sweetener.,"Errrr, I hate to tell you folks this, but this is made from the whole leaf, LOL. Check out the Sweetleaf website. This one is made more for topical applications. It won't hurt to drink it because it doesn't have anything harmful in it but it's more for skin irritations and such, that may be why you guys didn't like it in beverages.<br /><br />This dark concentrate is renowned for its ability to soften skin and help to smooth out wrinkles. Just apply, and after 30 to 60 minutes wash it away. It's worth trying on any skin problem. You'll be amazed!<br /><br /> Unrefined whole leaf concentrate made with water<br />- Helps pancreas<br />- May help regulate blood sugar levels<br />- Can be used as a topical agent for blemishes<br /><br />It's still sweet and you could use it that way, but since it's made from the whole leaf all those great plant phenols and stuff are flavoring the coffee;)<br /><br />It's a very easy mistake to make with Stevia.<br /><br />Having said that, I'll say this. Sweetleaf is the only company I've run across so far that doesn't add fillers and other sugars to their Stevia. I love Sweetleaf Stevia.<br /><br />Maltodextrin is a processed hydrolyzed starch used as a filler by a lot of companies.

2,Just plain BAD,"Pho is one of my all-time favorite foods. When I saw this at the grocery store, I was extremely excited. I'd been waiting for a product like this for a long time. I bought both the chicken and veggie varieties.<br /><br />Both flavors were terrible.  Neither tastes anything like any bowl of Pho I've ever tasted. It's horrific.

5,Chocolate-Flavored Nuts- But Not Really,"Emerald Cocoa Roast Almonds are almonds roasted with cocoa rather than covered with chocolate, which makes them healthier and less fattening than traditional chocolate-covered almonds. This is is an advantage if you don't want to have to wear clothing made in Indonesia, a highly laudable goal considering that country's trumped-up 2005 drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist. What's more, they taste excellent, too.

4,Desert Roses,"I recently ordered two of these lovely little plants, the Sparkle Star and the classic pink-flowering desert rose.  Both arrived well-packed and right on time, and are healthy with new growth sprouting at the top.<br /><br />The larger plant, the Sparkle Star, came without soil (as per the description) and many of the bottom leaves have fallen off due to transport stress.  However, as I said before there is a good deal of new growth, and they are hardy little plants in general.  If you're looking for a nice plant to keep indoors (in a well-lighted area), I'd definitely recommend these plants and this seller.<br /><br />Just a note: desert roses are poisonous, so wash your hands well after touching the plants, and keep out of the way of pets and young children.",Positive,recently ordered two lovely little plant sparkle star classic pinkflowering desert rose arrived wellpacked right time healthy new growth sprouting topthe larger plant sparkle star came without soil per description many bottom leaf fallen due transport stress however said good deal new growth hardy little plant general youre looking nice plant keep indoors welllighted area id definitely recommend plant sellerjust note desert rose poisonous wash hand well touching plant keep way pet young child

5,yum,I take a medication for my Rheumatoid arthritis which leaves a nasty aftertaste in my mouth. I also have dry mouth from Sj&ouml;grens's. I have been using Life Savers for a while now to help with these problems. I seem to go through a roll in fairly short time. I like the rolls because they seem to cause less trash. However these bags were too good a bargain to pass up. I had been out when the package arrived so I opened the bag right away. The mints were nice and fresh. They tasted great. Later I am going to try to see if they really will spark when I chew them. But even if they don't I am really pleased with this order. Thanks.

5,My daily supplements..,"This is one of the best products in the array of ""greens"" out on the market.  The taste is most definitely one of the best.  Green Superfood is a great addition to a balanced alkaline/acid diet.  When my body is overly acidic (which is obvious when my stomach or body is sluggish or feeling like I'm coming down with something), I make a shake and it helps to balance it out.  I used to add a few items to the mix to make it even more powerful, i.e. fresh kale, banana, aloe, and flax oil.  Nowadays I simply use a frozen half banana, flax oil, and a touch of carob powder.  Mix it up with a bit of ice and you have a great shake, especially good during the summer months.  And for some crazy ideas, especially during the really hot months, add a bit of Baileys or Kahlua to the mix.  Yum, yum!  It's like having your vegetables with your junk food.  Or maybe try adding some Breyer's Mint Chocolate Chip ice cream and present it to the kids (sans the liquor, of course).  There is a kids version of this product, also.  Both an adult version and the kids version come in chocolate, but I like making that decision for myself, so I buy the plain.  This is a great way to get your vits/minerals in a powdered, raw food product.  It's gluten free, vegan, and no soy fillers.  Also, 70% organic.  You would have to eat a truck load of raw foods to get the same level of nutrients that you receive in one scoop of Amazing Grass Green SuperFood.  And no, I do not work for the company.",Positive,one best product array green market taste definitely one best green superfood great addition balanced alkalineacid diet body overly acidic obvious stomach body sluggish feeling like im coming something make shake help balance used add item mix make even powerful ie fresh kale banana aloe flax oil nowadays simply use frozen half banana flax oil touch carob powder mix bit ice great shake especially good summer month crazy idea especially really hot month add bit bailey kahlua mix yum yum like vegetable junk food maybe try adding breyers mint chocolate chip ice cream present kid sans liquor course kid version product also adult version kid version come chocolate like making decision buy plain great way get vitsminerals powdered raw food product gluten free vegan soy filler also organic would eat truck load raw food get level nutrient receive one scoop amazing grass green superfood work company

5,SUPERIOR to a lame jar,"I first tried sprouting with a jar with a drain lid. It was hard to drain the water all the way out, it was a pain to rinse the seeds, and my sprouts would rot, before they even sprouted. Air couldn't get to them, and I live in Nebraska, a very arid region.<br /><br />Then I got this thing. If you can't grow sprouts in this, just rinse them more. It drains effortlessly. The instructions are ridiculously easy to follow. You can grow tons of sprouts really fast. I grew, tall, strong, deep green, and super potent sprouts in a matter of days. They will not go bad if you keep them in here and keep rinsing them, I rinse about 3 times a day, but you could probably get away with once depending on where you live. You will basically have a living, growing food, that you can eat at your leisure.<br /><br />The smallest seed I have put in them so far is radish, but I'm sure smaller seeds could work, and you could always put a growing sponge on the bottom.<br /><br />During the winter I will get a second one because it will be one of the only ways to get fresh greens in my area, and I'm a vegetarian, so that is super important to me.<br /><br />These are made in the US.",Positive,first tried sprouting jar drain lid hard drain water way pain rinse seed sprout would rot even sprouted air couldnt get live nebraska arid regionthen got thing cant grow sprout rinse drain effortlessly instruction ridiculously easy follow grow ton sprout really fast grew tall strong deep green super potent sprout matter day go bad keep keep rinsing rinse time day could probably get away depending live basically living growing food eat leisurethe smallest seed put far radish im sure smaller seed could work could always put growing sponge bottomduring winter get second one one way get fresh green area im vegetarian super important methese made u

1,beware of this food,"About a year ago I decided to put my dog on a better food as she was (at the time) 11 yeas old and I want her to live the longest, healthiest life possible, much like everyone else, as she is not just a pet to me but also a daughter. I stopped at my local ""mom & pop"" pet food store and asked some questions. I knew little about the better brands as she's always been on grocery store brands. I was directed toward Orijen as it is one of the better brands out there, it's very high in protein, you can understand all of the ingredients and it's ""so healthy, a human could eat it"". Of course I bought it, and my dog loved it. Little did I know how damaging the food was to her, as quite honestly, she exhibited no symptoms. Back in January my dog had to be put in the ICU due to an accident. It was during that stay where the vet noticed how high her liver levels were. Her alkaline & phosphatase as well as her calcium levels in the kidneys were all very high as well. The vet put her on 3 different liver support medicines and we had to follow up every month with more blood work to reassess the situation. After the 3rd month, the vet was suspicious that cancer was present. When I hear that, I immediately did some research on the food. It was then that I noticed how high the protein content is and what that much protein could do to a body. I presented my research and concerns to the vet, who wasn't as convinced as I was. After the 4th blood draw, and still no changes, we made the mutual decision to wean her off of Orijen and on to Science Diet (although just about any other brand would have worked too). A month later after the switch, and my dog was presented with a clean bill of health. Her alkaline & phosphatase levels are still slightly elevated, but I'm told there is nothing to worry about now. We concluded it was the food that was damaging and slowly killing her, as she was deemed healthy at the start of feeding her the food, A few months prior to all of this, she went though a full work up in order to get her teeth cleaned.<br /><br />I write this not to slander Orijen, I only want to educate others on my own personal experience. While it happened to my dog, that doesn't mean it will effect all dogs the same. Just please keep in mind, my dog showed no symptoms while on the food that anything was wrong. If it weren't for her stay in the hospital, we never would have known how much damage this food was causing her. If your dog is presently on this food, maybe a precautionary blood draw at their next exam would be worth your while.",Negative,year ago decided put dog better food time yea old want live longest healthiest life possible much like everyone else pet also daughter stopped local mom pop pet food store asked question knew little better brand shes always grocery store brand directed toward orijen one better brand high protein understand ingredient healthy human could eat course bought dog loved little know damaging food quite honestly exhibited symptom back january dog put icu due accident stay vet noticed high liver level alkaline phosphatase well calcium level kidney high well vet put different liver support medicine follow every month blood work reassess situation rd month vet suspicious cancer present hear immediately research food noticed high protein content much protein could body presented research concern vet wasnt convinced th blood draw still change made mutual decision wean orijen science diet although brand would worked month later switch dog presented clean bill health alkaline phosphatase level still slightly elevated im told nothing worry concluded food damaging slowly killing deemed healthy start feeding food month prior went though full work order get teeth cleanedi write slander orijen want educate others personal experience happened dog doesnt mean effect dog please keep mind dog showed symptom food anything wrong werent stay hospital never would known much damage food causing dog presently food maybe precautionary blood draw next exam would worth

I immediately wanted more, so I found them on here and now get a box delivered monthly. I use them as a healthy snack at work, at home, or when I'm out cycling. At the auto-deliver price, they work out to around $.80 per bar or so, which I think is very reasonable. I'm happy to have a ""good fat"" snack in the house for us to eat, instead of resorting to chips, candy bars, etc. I did counsel my family that they can only have one per day, as while they're good fat, they should still be eaten in moderation. :) Anyways - they're delicious!

Coffee keurig, but the flavor isn't what I expected.

The babycook actually created a creamy paste out of the food and my little one has LOVED the food I've made.

2,Just ok,"I like the Tortuga original better than this cake. First of all the rum is cooked with butter and other ingredients, depending on how you like to make it, and made into a glaze. There are some people that think the rum is soaked in straight from the bottle and I am going to assume that these people don't drink. In this brand the rum is not as intense. I am not sure what brand or type of rum they use but it is weak. The cake is crumbly, it was falling apart as I tried to slice it.

There is no guarantee that this is the case with ""natural"" products such as this and likely they could be GMO and sprayed with pesticides.

Etna).<br /><br />Coffee preference is a very personal issue; we each have our favorite brands and brews.  For me Illy is at the top of the list.  So, if you like Peet's Italian Roast or Starbucks Cafe Verona, this may be a brew for you.<br /><br />Drink it cold from the can and pry those eyes open!",Positive,illy issimo coffee drink cafe exactly promise strong black sweet italian espressoat calorie sweeter would personally choose sweet enjoyi drink mine cold straight attempt wake greet daythe warns shake thats carbonated fizzy full shaking cause enough expansion drink spew think mt etnacoffee preference personal issue favorite brand brew illy top list like peets italian roast starbucks cafe verona may brew youdrink cold pry eye open

3,I'm not impressed,"I decided to purchase this balsamic after reading a few good reviews.<br /><br />From what I heard from a few people, I expected much more.  This is a watery vinegar and does not cling to your food like the better balsamics. I put a couple drops on some cheese and they instantly rolled off onto the plate. It's also much more sour than I expected.  The bottle should have a smaller opening as it drips down the side and pours out too quickly.  I'd recommend ripping out the plastic piece and dumping it in a cruet.<br /><br />It is smooth as some others have said and does not leave a bad aftertaste.  I think I'll save this for cooking and dressing rather than drizzling on food.  I imagine it would make a good reduction.  It does make a decent vinaigrette as I mixed it with olive oil and had a salad for breakfast this morning.  You don't need a lot.<br /><br />It's simply not up to par with better balsamics that work well with eveything. I'm partial to thicker, sweeter balsamics, so take that as you will.  If you like thinner, tangier balsamics then this may be for you.  I'd consider this more of a recipe ingredient than a condiment.<br /><br />The Amazon price is also on the high side.  You can currently get two bottles of this exact product on eBay for $12.",Neutral,decided purchase balsamic reading good reviewsfrom heard people expected much watery vinegar cling food like better balsamics put couple drop cheese instantly rolled onto plate also much sour expected bottle smaller opening drip side pours quickly id recommend ripping plastic piece dumping cruetit smooth others said leave bad aftertaste think ill save cooking dressing rather drizzling food imagine would make good reduction make decent vinaigrette mixed olive oil salad breakfast morning dont need lotits simply par better balsamics work well eveything im partial thicker sweeter balsamics take like thinner tangier balsamics may id consider recipe ingredient condimentthe amazon price also high side currently get two bottle exact product ebay

I ordered this just to see how it tasted because the price was so good, if it didn't taste right, I'd just use it on my skin. It is the BEST tasting oil I've tried.

4,Better if thicker,"My nephew seems to enjoy these purees.  My only comments are:<br /><br />- it is a bit watery.  If it was slightly thicker, it would make feeding much easier as it would be much easier to get it into his mouth.  To make it thicker, I blend the puree with a little banana or steamed yams to give it a thicker consistency and make it easier to eat.<br /><br />- Another note is that each pouch is so large.  The instructions indicate to use within 24 hours of opening.  In my nephew's case, he's 6 months old.  There is no way he will be able to finish a single 4.5oz pouch in 24 hrs in addition to drinking his milk.

I am still hoping though, so I transferred them to a different container and cut out all the dead parts.

This food was recommended by a friend so we tried it out and my beagle loved it. Granted, he's a beagle and will eat anything. But, I noticed huge improvements in his health after eating this food. He would often vomit after eating when he ate an omni diet and have digestive issues. He was never a dog that could eat meat straight up without getting sick, so perhaps he was sensitive to even the high end food with meat in it I had him on before this. He has rarely thrown up since having him on vegan food, if at all. It's been so long I can't remember. His weight has been easier to manage, and he has a nicer coat and even better smelling breath! All his vet visits have been great. I totally recommend vegan diets for doggies and specifically this brand of food. I usually buy a big bag of it, get the free shipping, and am good for a while.",Positive,found dog could live healthily vegan jumped chance share diet mine food recommended friend tried beagle loved granted he beagle eat anything noticed huge improvement health eating food would often vomit eating ate omni diet digestive issue never dog could eat meat straight without getting sick perhaps sensitive even high end food meat rarely thrown since vegan food long cant remember weight easier manage nicer coat even better smelling breath vet visit great totally recommend vegan diet doggy specifically brand food usually buy big bag get free shipping good

5,Downright Addictive!,"These are a great go-to snack/meal when you're in a rush and don't want chips or hotdogs.<br /><br />The nuggets are about the size of a stack of three quarters with some smaller ones the size of a couple of nickels.<br /><br />The flavor is spicy with a nice tang.<br /><br />The texture is softer than jerky but not as soft as say summer sausage.<br /><br />Quick comment on quantity - there are three servings, 60 calories each, in the package.

5,Do Your Homework,"A friend of mine knows that I like to watch what I eat as far as the chemicals and un-necessary processing so she turned me on to these bars.  First let me say, they are awesome. They have next to no processing, ZERO chemicals, and are very tastey.  Yes, they are hard.  What do you expect?? They're nuts!!! Nuts are hard!!!  The little pieces of the dried fruit they put in add a little sweetness but, they're still nuts and therefore crunchy. It's just like putting a handful of almonds in your mouth.<br /><br />In regards to the fat content, any health related magazine, doctor, and/or website will tell you that some of the ABSOLUTE best items to eat to help weight management and a live a healthy lifestyle are nuts and seeds.  They contain all of the good fat that you're body needs while hopefully, helping you stay away from the man-created/altered fats that destroy our cholestrol, hearts and general well-being. Just like coconut, high in fat, but one the best things you could possibly put into your body. Remember, everything in moderation.<br /><br />In regards to the size, yes they're small.  They are not a meal replacement bar but it is a decent amount of protein and good fats to satisfy you for a few hours until you can sit down and enjoy a healthy dinner.  While I try to eat 5 small meals a day, in my line of work, it's just not possible so I snack on one of these during the times I just can't have a decent meal and they get me through.  And have you checked out the price of nuts lately????  Any good raw nut costs upwards of $6.00lb, I've seen some as high as $18.00lb.  So, to have this bar prepared, shipped packaged and sold for about a $1.00 (just buy them in bulk, Costco is even cheaper) seems like a good deal to me.<br /><br />In regards to manufacturing, while I do wish they were put together closer to home, first and foremost, they are a business.  They have to watch their bottom line just like any of us.  If you do your research you will find that very few of the ingredients come from China (only some seeds and rice malt, I believe because they can't get them anywhere else).  Most of the ingredients come from the US then are shipped to China for manufacturing in a facility built specifically for Mrs. Mays.  Think about it.  If you can pay the same amount and have either 20 people or 1 person do a job, and those 20 people are being paid a good wage in their country, which makes more business sense.  Now, I don't like it, but I can understand it. Considering labor costs in this country, imagaine how much these bars would cost if manufactured here? And given the issues coming out of China recently, do you really think anyone manufacturing there would risk doing anything less than spectacular??? Not if they want to stay in business.<br />Check out their website for their safety and health inspection related info.<br /><br />What it boils down to is this, if you want a great little, portable, and extremely healthy snack and you're nuts about nuts, then you will love these bars.  Do we all wish they were made in the US, sure.  But barring that, they are a great product for any health conscious individual as well as vegetarians and vegans alike.  Like I said earlier, they're awesome!!",Positive,friend mine know like watch eat far chemical unnecessary processing turned bar first let say awesome next processing zero chemical tastey yes hard expect theyre nut nut hard little piece dried fruit put add little sweetness theyre still nut therefore crunchy like putting handful almond mouthin regard fat content health related magazine doctor andor website tell absolute best item eat help weight management live healthy lifestyle nut seed contain good fat youre body need hopefully helping stay away mancreatedaltered fat destroy cholestrol heart general wellbeing like coconut high fat one best thing could possibly put body remember everything moderationin regard size yes theyre small meal replacement bar decent amount protein good fat satisfy hour sit enjoy healthy dinner try eat small meal day line work possible snack one time cant decent meal get checked price nut lately good raw nut cost upwards lb ive seen high lb bar prepared shipped packaged sold buy bulk costco even cheaper seems like good deal mein regard manufacturing wish put together closer home first foremost business watch bottom line like u research find ingredient come china seed rice malt believe cant get anywhere else ingredient come u shipped china manufacturing facility built specifically mr may think pay amount either people person job people paid good wage country make business sense dont like understand considering labor cost country imagaine much bar would cost manufactured given issue coming china recently really think anyone manufacturing would risk anything less spectacular want stay businesscheck website safety health inspection related infowhat boil want great little portable extremely healthy snack youre nut nut love bar wish made u sure barring great product health conscious individual well vegetarian vegan alike like said earlier theyre awesome

4,Change the Name,"Not quite sure why this is called Mocha Java, since the Mocha flavor is lacking.  However, the coffee is quite smooth and it is perhaps one of my husband's favorites.  I on the other hand prefer something with a little more chocolate flavor such as Timothy's German Chocolate Cake. This blend definitely has the hint of choclate that I was looking for when I ordered the Mocha Java but it also has a touch of coconut flavor and a scent that I enjoy.  In Timothy's defense, they don't truly market Mocha Java as a Flavored coffee but rather as a ""medium roast"" blend of ""Ethiopian and Sumatran coffees"".  However, unless you really researched this, the name is misleading.",Positive,quite sure called mocha java since mocha flavor lacking however coffee quite smooth perhaps one husband favorite hand prefer something little chocolate flavor timothy german chocolate cake blend definitely hint choclate looking ordered mocha java also touch coconut flavor scent enjoy timothy defense dont truly market mocha java flavored coffee rather medium roast blend ethiopian sumatran coffee however unless really researched name misleading

3,First food my dog doesn't care for,"I tried this for the first time recently. My budget was tight, but I was not willing to feed my dog ""junk"" food, so after some searching, ""CSDLS"" seemed like the most bang for the buck. The sales person advised me to buy a smaller bag before diving into the 35 pounder to make sure my dog would eat it. I chuckled and told him my dog has never met a food she doesn't like...until now. Now mind you, I have a lab. Labs love food and will eat just about anything. This is the first food that she is not excited to eat. :( She will eat it just b/c she's starving, but it's with much less enthusiasm. She even stops eating after a few bites, walks away, and then reluctantly finishes. She has never done this in her life. It's too bad. I was hoping she would like this, but now it's back to the more expensive brands.",Neutral,tried first time recently budget tight willing feed dog junk food searching csdls seemed like bang buck sale person advised buy smaller bag diving pounder make sure dog would eat chuckled told dog never met food doesnt likeuntil mind lab lab love food eat anything first food excited eat eat bc shes starving much less enthusiasm even stop eating bite walk away reluctantly finish never done life bad hoping would like back expensive brand

However, I didn't examine the picture closely enough, because I was surprised to see that the cans were not pull-tab and I had to dig out a can opener.  Inconvenient, especially since I feed my cats in the laundry room in the basement, not in our tiny kitchen.  Five or six of the cans were dented (I ordered a total of 24), a couple pretty severely.  I'm not sure what the box went through with the shippers, but even the cans need better padding!",Positive,appreciate able buy larger economical size amazon however didnt examine picture closely enough surprised see can pulltab dig opener inconvenient especially since feed cat laundry room basement tiny kitchen five six can dented ordered total couple pretty severely im sure box went shipper even can need better padding
4,Kind of shocked to like this!,"Not exactly the highest possible praise, but as something of a coffee snob, I was surprised to find this so palatable.  And really, if you need a caffeine hit, isn't it better to down something that didn't have to be formulated inside of a lab?  Five Hour Energy Drinks, I'm talking to *you*.<br /><br />What's in the can?  Coffee, beet sugar, potassium carbonate and potassium citrate.  Those last two you can buy in the vitamin/supplement aisle of your drugstore, and they do have natural antacid properties - I don't think they are used here as preservatives, but rather to tone down coffee's natural acidity.  I get good balance in the flavor of the coffee, so it's easy to enjoy without the addition of milk - great for me as a lactose-intolerant coffee drinker.  If you happen to already cold-brew in the fridge at home for lower acid, you'll appreciate the difference.  On the other hand, if you're a huge fan of bright, acid-y Central American coffees as opposed to the deeper Sumatrans and Suwalesis, then for you this might be a deficit.<br /><br />I'd keep this around in warm weather to offer iced to guests.  It's true that you can probably brew a better cup, if you start with good beans, but I think the convenience here is worth the price, particularly if you don't normally brew much coffee. Roasted beans kept in storage go stale - FAST.<br /><br />For decades, Illy has enjoyed a reputation for reliable, if not exceptional quality, and I'd sooner have one of these than a Starbucks canned or a McCafe any day.

Now I can easiy tell when the serums and creams are penetrating.  My skin is much more even in color, hydrated, healthy looking.  I apply the mask work into my skin for a few seconds and leave on for 15 minutes.  Remove  in shower and use a microdermabrasion product to remove dead skin after I rinse off the mask. I use a heavy cream on my skin after my serums to seal in moisture.  The skin on my chest was pebble like and I hated it.  This product has removed that look. That took over a week to change, but wow I can wear lower cut tops now and my skin is radiant!  My hands were looking rough.  My knuckles were so dry even lotion did not help.  I use this on my hands every night, remove with a microdermabrasion product then apply a thick lotion.  Finally my hands look very nice.  I have stocked up on this product, I never want to run out.

5,Interesting Extra Fine Ground Coffee,"A package of coffee that's LARGER than 1 pound, imagine that! And you get 3 of those nice large bags in your order.  Plus the price is extremely reasonable especially for an import.<br /><br />The first thing I noted about this coffee is that it is very tightly vacuum sealed - no air in the bag.<br />When you open the bag you get a lovely waft of fresh ground coffee.<br /><br />The coffee itself is ground extra fine to what is very much like a powder, quite dark in color and even though ground to that gauge is nice and moist with an acceptable amount of oiliness.<br /><br />The extra fine grind makes using a paper filter a necessity - you can use a gold tone filter but it will clog with grounds so must be scrubbed after use and you will, most likely, find grounds in the bottom of your pot.<br /><br />No matter what coffee we brew in our auto drip pot we start the brewing process and then pause it for a short time allowing the grounds to 'bloom' and then restart the brewing until completion.<br /><br />We have found that this coffee as most of the Made in Germany coffees we've tried has a slight acidity and an earthy undertone in the flavor. Not a negative if that appeals to you. We enjoy it after dinner but prefer a lighter roasted bean for our morning cups.<br /><br />As with any coffee, liking this coffee very much or disliking it comes down to personal taste.<br /><br />At the price it's certainly worth trying.",Positive,package coffee thats larger pound imagine get nice large bag order plus price extremely reasonable especially importthe first thing noted coffee tightly vacuum sealed air bagwhen open bag get lovely waft fresh ground coffeethe coffee ground extra fine much like powder quite dark color even though ground gauge nice moist acceptable amount oilinessthe extra fine grind make using paper filter necessity use gold tone filter clog ground must scrubbed use likely find ground bottom potno matter coffee brew auto drip pot start brewing process pause short time allowing ground bloom restart brewing completionwe found coffee made germany coffee weve tried slight acidity earthy undertone flavor negative appeal enjoy dinner prefer lighter roasted bean morning cupsas coffee liking coffee much disliking come personal tasteat price certainly worth trying

I'm really healthy like that ;  So I invited some of my best girlfriends over for a tasting party and OMG things got CRAY!  I have to add that my boyfriend and I got into a huge fight earlier that day about him not wanting me to wear these really cute shorts that I found on sale at TJ Max that were like short but not THAT short, and I had this really cute top that I wanted to wear with them but he was like ""you look super slutty in those shorts"" and I was all like ""Whatever Ramondo, you wear like those cholo shirts out every day and I don't say anything about that!""  Anyways, point being I was ready to try something new!  So the water arrived and all my girlfriends and I each took a bottle.

5,Textured Vegetable Protein,I have cooked with Textured Vegetable Protein for years and use it in my spaghetti sauce instead of ground meat. I've also used it in Chili with beans and soups.

5,She's licking the bowl twice a day!!,"I have been trying to find a nutritious food for my picky 6 pound, 1 year old, terrier/poodle/mutt and runt of the litter. Went through Puppy Chow, generic puppy chow, and Iams and then I started reading up on dog foods- and boy, did I learn a lot! No more grocery store food unless it is an ""emergency"" where getting online is not possible or we run out before the shipment arrives. That stuff is pure crap.<br /><br />We then went through a bag of Orijen, which I think is an excellent food, but not for her. She would eat it with toppings only and rarely ate all of it. Stools were often loose- not to mention the gas.<br /><br />A tiny dog can only eat about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of food per day so he/she needs to eat it all and it needs to be packed with nutrition. Back to the drawing board since the Orijen didn't work!<br /><br />Next we tried the Wellness Super5Mix Adult Small Breed. She eats every bite and licks the dish and sometimes wants an evening snack of the plain Wellness kibble. She eats it without any topping but I do usually mix in a TBS of wet food (or cottage cheese) which Wellness recommends in order to give the dog a bit of extra fluid. We live in the desert, so that's important. Anyway, she REALLY loves that! She has cleaned her plate twice daily ever since I started her on this wonderful food. The stools are formed and no gas.<br /><br />It seems to be the perfect food for her- and maybe for other dogs too which is why I am writing this. It is such a relief to see her eating a good nutritious dog food and enjoying it.<br /><br />I would definitely give it a try if your dog has ""pickyness""/appetite/digestion issues, or if you just want to provide 4 star nutrition. It costs more than the grocery store stuff, but a small dog doesn't eat much so I make it fit into my budget. I try to include it in with the occasional larger Amazon order and get  free shipping. It may be available in pet stores as well, but I have to go 15-20 miles out of town to find a pet store, so ordering online is easier.<br /><br />I highly recommend trying this food.",Positive,trying find nutritious food picky pound year old terrierpoodlemutt runt litter went puppy chow generic puppy chow iams started reading dog food boy learn lot grocery store food unless emergency getting online possible run shipment arrives stuff pure crapwe went bag orijen think excellent food would eat topping rarely ate stool often loose mention gasa tiny dog eat cup food per day heshe need eat need packed nutrition back drawing board since orijen didnt worknext tried wellness supermix adult small breed eats every bite lick dish sometimes want evening snack plain wellness kibble eats without topping usually mix tb wet food cottage cheese wellness recommends order give dog bit extra fluid live desert thats important anyway really love cleaned plate twice daily ever since started wonderful food stool formed gasit seems perfect food maybe dog writing relief see eating good nutritious dog food enjoying iti would definitely give try dog pickynessappetitedigestion issue want provide star nutrition cost grocery store stuff small dog doesnt eat much make fit budget try include occasional larger amazon order get free shipping may available pet store well go mile town find pet store ordering online easieri highly recommend trying food

1,"Not good for low carb, okay tasting",I've been on a low carb diet and bought these.  I wouldn't recommend them.  They aren't bad tasting especially if your craving chocolate/peanut butter.  I get the gitters and feel awful after I eat one.  I have tried Atkin's products which also have the sugar alcohol and 3 net carbs.  I never get the gitters and it curbs my hunger.

1,Quality has gone downhill,"I had been buying these treats for my cavachon for the past two years. He loved them.<br /><br />The last batch was of noticeably lower quality...dry and crunchy rather than moist and chewy.

3,Less Really IS More,"Given that Salt & Pepper is my favorite potato chip flavor (specifically Kettle Brand Krinkle Cut for those who might be interested) and I love cashews, I was looking forward to trying these. Alas, once again, Emerald has managed to just miss the mark.<br />I like only enough salt in my food to enhance the taste, and the fact of the matter is that cashews are flavorful enough that not a whole lot is necessary. These nuts--which are nice and crisp and unbroken, no problem there--could easily lose 75% of their added salt and they'd be great, especially given that the black pepper used is of pretty good quality and kinda kicks in after everything has been eaten...if you can refrain from gulping your beverage of choice to slake the salt-induced thirst, that is. There's also some onion powder added, which would be a good thing if it were only discernible. But it's not because of the salt.<br />The lion's share of the nutritional data peeled off when I opened the canister, so I'm not able to provide them (I think I can be forgiven for not rifling through the garbage). Cashews are relatively low in fat for nuts, but they're not a low-cal food by any stretch of the imagination, plus these are roasted in peanut oil as well. I personally think nuts, plain or flavored, are a great source of nutrition but only if I can actually taste them.<br />In my experience, the single ingredient most common to mass-produced foods is salt, which seems a shame to me, especially since its misuse is so unhealthful. It's a lot easier to add salt to a dish than remove it, so if you're interested in actually tasting your food (and I think even simple, inexpensive food should and can be wonderful), let the manufacturers know. This product could easily be delicious if whoever formulated it would put a bit more finesse into it.",Neutral,given salt pepper favorite potato chip flavor specifically kettle brand krinkle cut might interested love cashew looking forward trying ala emerald managed miss marki like enough salt food enhance taste fact matter cashew flavorful enough whole lot necessary nutswhich nice crisp unbroken problem therecould easily lose added salt theyd great especially given black pepper used pretty good quality kinda kick everything eatenif refrain gulping beverage choice slake saltinduced thirst there also onion powder added would good thing discernible saltthe lion share nutritional data peeled opened canister im able provide think forgiven rifling garbage cashew relatively low fat nut theyre lowcal food stretch imagination plus roasted peanut oil well personally think nut plain flavored great source nutrition actually taste themin experience single ingredient common massproduced food salt seems shame especially since misuse unhealthful lot easier add salt dish remove youre interested actually tasting food think even simple inexpensive food wonderful let manufacturer know product could easily delicious whoever formulated would put bit finesse

A couple weeks later, I was having a hard day and knew I was going to have a long night, so I figured why not try the freebie, it didn't cost me anything anyway.<br /><br />Oh My Gosh it worked so well!

5,No Bitter Taste like Other Green Teas,"My first impression of Stash's green chai tea is that it isn't bitter like other green teas. The spices are also mild. This tea contains green tea, cinnamon, ginger root, allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon flavor, clove bud oil and cardamom oil. I normally would not add milk to a green tea but adding two tablespoons of nonfat milk powder and a packet of stevia makes this tea perfectly soothing. If you don't like tea overly spicy this will appeal to you.

5,Pure and pristine,"On my quest to improve my overall health, I have been on the lookout for the best water I can possibly find so I can flush my system of toxins and, at the same time, have glowing skin.  Although I keep trying different brands, I always come back to ""Fiji"", the natural artesian water from the islands of the same name. ""Artesian"" means that the water is protected inside a volcanic rock formed millions of years ago. Because it's bottle at the source, the water preserves all its minerals literally untouched. The difference is also obvious to the naked eye, when upon looking through the attractive bottle, one can see the clarity and transparency that just makes one want to dive into its purity.<br /><br />Taste-wise it does not dissapoint either. Imported from the distant falls of Viti Levu, Fiji tastes free of all particles and just... fresh! I usually keep a bottle by my desk at work, and use it hot or cold, for tea, hot cocoa, or straight up.<br /><br />The typical analysis in mg/liter states:<br /><br />Silica: 85<br />Calcium: 17<br />Magnesium: 13<br />pH: 7.5<br />Bicarbonates: 140<br />Total dissolved solids: 210<br /><br />Cases are offered at a discount at the company's website for delivery in the USA.",Positive,quest improve overall health lookout best water possibly find flush system toxin time glowing skin although keep trying different brand always come back fiji natural artesian water island name artesian mean water protected inside volcanic rock formed million year ago bottle source water preserve mineral literally untouched difference also obvious naked eye upon looking attractive bottle one see clarity transparency make one want dive puritytastewise dissapoint either imported distant fall viti levu fiji taste free particle fresh usually keep bottle desk work use hot cold tea hot cocoa straight upthe typical analysis mgliter statessilica calcium magnesium ph bicarbonate total dissolved solid case offered discount company website delivery usa

3,Quick and tasty meal for when you don't have time for something more involved,"When time is short and the family is grumbling for something to eat, a boxed prepackaged meal can be a great way to get dinner handled.  Cook a little chicken and throw in the packaged cheese and veggies and you're good to go.  While not as fantastic as any given home cooked meal, Velveeta's cheesy skillets are easily on par or better than most varieties of the standard chicken/tuna/hamburger helpers available at the supermarket.<br /><br />There are a lot of ways to jazz the meal up or make it go farther for feeding more people, like adding in more vegetables or turning it into a casserole by baking a bread crumb crust on top. Although making it too much more exciting obviously defeats the purpose of having a quick and fast boxed meal sitting in the counter in the first place.<br /><br />For something simple and easy when you don't have time for a prepared meal, the chicken and broccoli cheesy skillet is a tasty and affordable option, it just won't knock your socks off and become your new favorite dinner.",Neutral,time short family grumbling something eat boxed prepackaged meal great way get dinner handled cook little chicken throw packaged cheese veggie youre good go fantastic given home cooked meal velveeta cheesy skillet easily par better variety standard chickentunahamburger helper available supermarketthere lot way jazz meal make go farther feeding people like adding vegetable turning casserole baking bread crumb crust top although making much exciting obviously defeat purpose quick fast boxed meal sitting counter first placefor something simple easy dont time prepared meal chicken broccoli cheesy skillet tasty affordable option wont knock sock become new favorite dinner

5,Very economical ounce for ounce compared to tubed wasabi,"Exported from Japan, this is a very good ""fake"" wasabi powder (nearly all tubed and powdered wasabi is actually horseradish). 25g of powder is a lot, so this can will last you a long long time, making this a very economical choice for sushi lovers. I bought a tin of it 2 years ago and have still not gone through it all. To prepare, just mix with a bit of cold water and wait several minutes for the flavor to develop, then enjoy with sushi or sashimi. My directions are vague as to how much to use and how long to wait because the can's directions are not specific. Reconstituted, it's every bit as good as tubed wasabi. I find that a teaspoon of powder is more than sufficient for one person.<br /><br />Make only as much as you need and right before you are about to use it. The chemicals that give horseradish (and real wasabi) its pungency are very volatile and will dissipate quickly when exposed to air (15-30 mins). Don't think you'll save time by making a big batch of it and refrigerating it until next time. All you'll taste is a coarse paste of green goop.<br /><br />Be aware that the product description is **WRONG**. This is not an all natural product.

Even though, I usually mix in some other kind of cereal with these, to make them more interesting.<br /><br />But the main reason for adding this review is that I was happy to find out a month ago that I could buy these at Amazon at a substantially lower price than the grocery store ($3.50 instead of $5.00).

5,Fix it up with Spam and REALLY go to town,"I thrive on these mashed potatoes, and also the equally excellent Betty Crocker Loaded Mashed Potatoes. I think I can hear an inner voice of my mother telling me 60 years ago that I shouldn't like prepared foods, but I ignore that voice a lot. These are extremely easy to make (I heat my water for four minutes in an 1100 watt microwave), and they taste pretty good just as they are.<br /><br />Of course, I rarely leave things just as they are. I sometimes add in some milk with my water. It gives the potatoes a richer taste. I also dice various versions of Spam, mix in some canned string beans and pitted black olives, heat everything up, and mix it in with the potatoes. That way it becomes a quick and easy entree.<br /><br />I suppose homemade mashed potatoes have their points. Just try making them when you're over 60. This product starts looking pretty attractive at that point. And the texture is actually better than the best homemade potatoes I've had (most homemade versions usually just end up lumpy, though).<br /><br />Anyway, I recommend these.

Compared to nutella, this blows it right out of the water, half the carbs and sugar and almost similar taste. However, this chocolate hazelnut butter has a salty like aftertaste. I'm afraid they use the sea salt so much (to prevent oil separation) that it messes up the potential of the flavor.

5,I eat these too much,"I'm kind of addicted to these.  I like both the Hot and Spicy and the Plain Lowrey's Bacon Curls Microwave Pork Rinds, but like the Hot and Spicy best.  I found the perfect time in my microwave of 1:20, but had to experiment to find the right amount of time.  Before taking them out of the plastic I shake them a little.  Once in a while they will fly out of the bag when I try to shake it when the bag is out of the plastic and opened flat like the directions show.  You really need to get them dispersed in the bag before popping if you want full big puffy pork rinds, which I think needs to be done more than 5-6 times like the directions state.  Some bags do seem fuller than others, however.  I have to agree these do stink when taken out of the microwave.  I turn my stove fan on before taking them out of the microwave and pour them out of the bag under the fan and hold the bag and bowl up to the fan for a few seconds.<br />I've tried dipping these into ranch dressing which is a bit of a treat too, but seems to make the porky too soggy, but I like the taste of it.",Positive,im kind addicted like hot spicy plain lowreys bacon curl microwave pork rind like hot spicy best found perfect time microwave experiment find right amount time taking plastic shake little fly bag try shake bag plastic opened flat like direction show really need get dispersed bag popping want full big puffy pork rind think need done time like direction state bag seem fuller others however agree stink taken microwave turn stove fan taking microwave pour bag fan hold bag bowl fan secondsive tried dipping ranch dressing bit treat seems make porky soggy like taste

I tried it w/ just water & it was okay & tried it w/ lowfat greek yogart & also w/ some fresh fruit blended in to make it more as a smoothie. I work 12 hrs shifts & sometimes having this as a meal replacement works well rather than a lot of snacks with  meal while working or for the grab & go breakfast @ 4am (mixed the night before & chilled overnight & put in water bottle).

I primarily make all my own baby food but don't like to take homemade food while out and about so I purchased these for when we are running errands. My little one doesn't seem to mind them but he has only had a few of the flavors. I decided to go with Earths Best because I wanted an organic product. I know some are worried about the BPA used in the lids but unfortunately I think BPA is used on all jars and cans and I wasn't able to find an alternative product that didn't use it.

With every other bold-strong coffee that I used to buy, I needed to use the 4oz setting on my Keurig or else it would be too weak. With this brand I can use the middle setting  (8oz) and it is still strong enough for me. Actually this saves money.

1,Milk Bone Crunch Original Dog Treats 40 Oz.,"For the informed thinker consumer...<br /><br />WHAT!!<br /><br />When you understand what the buzz words mean, you become an educated and informed consumer capable of making a good choice for your pet and your money pouch. So many of my friends' dogs are sick with cancer and other diseases. Whay are they eatting...? I made the choice will you; or do you like to have your ears tickled?<br /><br />The Painful Truth:<br /><br />You really do get what you pay for when it comes to pet food, as illustrated in Ann N. Martin's book, Food Pets Die For. First published in 1997 and updated in 2003, Martin's book was the first to expose the ingredients legally used by pet food companies, including euthanized cats and dogs, zoo animals, roadkill, and diseased and rotted meat unfit for human consumption. Lest you think that what Martin documented isn't widespread, she writes:<br /><br />""In later investigations in both the US and Canada, I was to learn that the collars, tags, flea collars, and even plastic bags in which (euthanized) pets are wrapped, are not removed before they are shoved in the rendering pit. Deceased pets are being 'recycled' into pet food, and pet owners have no knowledge of what is happening.""<br /><br />* Poultry by-product meal. By-products can include: intestines, chicken heads, duck bills, chicken and turkey feet, feathers and bone, soy, cottonseed hulls, corn cobs, peanut hulls, citrus pulp, screenings, weeds, straw, and cereal by-products. Ingredients listed as beef, chicken and poultry by-products are not required to include actual meat. Rendered meat can be ANY rendered mammal meat, including cats and dogs. If the ingredient contained enough meat that it could be measured, it would be labeled as MEAT.<br />* Digest of chicken by-products. Animal digest is a cooked-down broth made from unspecified parts of unspecified animals. Any kind of animal can be included, and the animals can be obtained from any source, so there is no control over quality or contamination.<br />* Corn gluten meal. Corn gluten is a cheap by-product of human food processing. It offers little nutritional value and serves mainly to bind food together.<br />* Soybean meal. Soybean meal is a poor quality protein filler. The Crude Protein analysis on pet food labels is only a measurement of the amount of nitrogen in a food -- not the quality of the protein. Because of this, pet food companies can use the cheaper by-products of human food production, such as soybean meal, to boost protein numbers.",Negative,informed thinker consumerwhatwhen understand buzz word mean become educated informed consumer capable making good choice pet money pouch many friend dog sick cancer disease whay eatting made choice like ear tickledthe painful truthyou really get pay come pet food illustrated ann n martin book food pet die first published updated martin book first expose ingredient legally used pet food company including euthanized cat dog zoo animal roadkill diseased rotted meat unfit human consumption lest think martin documented isnt widespread writesin later investigation u canada learn collar tag flea collar even plastic bag euthanized pet wrapped removed shoved rendering pit deceased pet recycled pet food pet owner knowledge happening poultry byproduct meal byproduct include intestine chicken head duck bill chicken turkey foot feather bone soy cottonseed hull corn cob peanut hull citrus pulp screening weed straw cereal byproduct ingredient listed beef chicken poultry byproduct required include actual meat rendered meat rendered mammal meat including cat dog ingredient contained enough meat could measured would labeled meat digest chicken byproduct animal digest cookeddown broth made unspecified part unspecified animal kind animal included animal obtained source control quality contamination corn gluten meal corn gluten cheap byproduct human food processing offer little nutritional value serf mainly bind food together soybean meal soybean meal poor quality protein filler crude protein analysis pet food label measurement amount nitrogen food quality protein pet food company use cheaper byproduct human food production soybean meal boost protein number

5,Excellent Green Tea from a real Tea drinker!,"I have had the pleasure of exploring and experimenting with Green tea for the last five years. During that time, I believe that I have sampled the gamut of options on the market today. From rare, true Gyokuro tea from Kyoto, Japan at a friend's home which cost over $500USD/lb to cheap generic Sencha. I have had the pleasure to seek out various types of green tea from Lung Chung, Putuo Fo Cha and many others. I am always searching, tasting and learning about tea and its amazing health benefits.<br /><br />However, I was looking for something both readily available, cost effective and of excellent quality. Not an easy combination of traits at all considering my experience. I settled on the Stash brands of Teas and this version being the organic version was just pennies more than the non-organic green tea version from Stash. After researching, I discovered that this tea is grown and processed not in Japan but Brazil, yet from my personal experience, it rivals the Japanese tea leaf for leaf.<br /><br />The warm, rich tea that is produced after a moderate boiling temperature is very refreshing. Personally, I steep for about 3 minutes today and then allow it to rest up to a mild warm temperature where you can truly start tasting the mild notes of organic flavor. There is no taste of excessive tannins, bitterness, nor rough processing that comes through in its flavor. It is quite purely, an excellent tasting, fresh & mild form of green tea. Very enjoyable and surprising! :)<br /><br />Color is medium green to very slight brown in cup. Expected since this tea is not produced in the traditional ""Gyokuro"" shade growing and yielding techniques, but it is actually very flavorful and easy to drink. (Even for new green tea drinkers who might be turned off by some of the most traditional blends) --- something I cannot say for some of the more expensive Green teas. They can be quite hard to get used to at first!<br /><br />I can add nothing else but to note that for the price and for the fact that it is truly certified organic, I cannot recommend this tea enough.<br />It is a simply outstanding value for an excellent variety, flavor and production of pure green tea. For about $0.15 a cup, I cannot imagine where else you could possible buy a more flavorful organic drink that has so many tremendously wonderful health benefits.<br /><br />Cheers to STASH Tea for bringing us such an amazing cup of Green Tea goodness. Even after traveling the world and back, I was pleasantly surprised to find this STASH tea....At this price, I will make it a great habit of STASHING more of this away for safe keeping.",Positive,pleasure exploring experimenting green tea last five year time believe sampled gamut option market today rare true gyokuro tea kyoto japan friend home cost usdlb cheap generic sencha pleasure seek various type green tea lung chung putuo fo cha many others always searching tasting learning tea amazing health benefitshowever looking something readily available cost effective excellent quality easy combination trait considering experience settled stash brand tea version organic version penny nonorganic green tea version stash researching discovered tea grown processed japan brazil yet personal experience rival japanese tea leaf leafthe warm rich tea produced moderate boiling temperature refreshing personally steep minute today allow rest mild warm temperature truly start tasting mild note organic flavor taste excessive tannin bitterness rough processing come flavor quite purely excellent tasting fresh mild form green tea enjoyable surprising color medium green slight brown cup expected since tea produced traditional gyokuro shade growing yielding technique actually flavorful easy drink even new green tea drinker might turned traditional blend something say expensive green tea quite hard get used firsti add nothing else note price fact truly certified organic recommend tea enoughit simply outstanding value excellent variety flavor production pure green tea cup imagine else could possible buy flavorful organic drink many tremendously wonderful health benefitscheers stash tea bringing u amazing cup green tea goodness even traveling world back pleasantly surprised find stash teaat price make great habit stashing away safe keeping

5,so tasty!,"My local food co-op had a sale on various tortas de aceita from Ines Rosales.  I picked up some of the rosemary and thyme as well the cinnamon.  While I like the cinnamon flavor a bit better than the rosemary and thyme, both are very good.  Each box has six individually wrapped (in wax paper) tortas.  I like to place a couple in the oven for a few moments before eating them.  The rosemary and thyme flavor is a great soup or salad accompaniment.  If you want a treat to pair with a tea, go for the aforementioned cinnamon flavor.<br /><br />I will also note that these appear to be a hard-to-find item.  Before locating them at my co-op, I didn't even know they existed and I frequently pick up foods from the international foods sections of large grocery store chains and at local ethnic groceries.

They substituted  flavors I didn't want or like and left out the ones I was really wanting.  They also just threw them in the box,bad packaging.

3,A little too bitter,"As a former St*rbucks drinker, I find I'm always looking for coffee that's ""just a little stronger"". Jet Fuel fills that need nicely. I can finally drink a good strong cup of coffee without going broke.<br />EDIT 5/6/10<br />I have returned to edit this review after trying Green Mountain's REVV. I am dropping this review to 3 stars because REVV is just so much better.<br />I found jet fuel to be a little bitter. The first time I drank it I went a little heavy on the half & half and didn't notice it. Over time the bitterness becomes quite distinct.<br />I have found that I much prefer REVV for the caffeine kick it provides while still being incredibly smooth.",Neutral,former strbucks drinker find im always looking coffee thats little stronger jet fuel fill need nicely finally drink good strong cup coffee without going brokeedit returned edit review trying green mountain revv dropping review star revv much betteri found jet fuel little bitter first time drank went little heavy half half didnt notice time bitterness becomes quite distincti found much prefer revv caffeine kick provides still incredibly smooth

This tea is amazing, I used to drink coffee like a mad women now I drink 1-2 cups and then it's the Guayusa tea. I actually can feel the difference when I drink this tea, energized but not jittery, focused and the taste of this tea is like no other.

5,Great Food for high energy dog with digestive problems!,"At 40 per cent high quality protein, this is great food for a young, healthy, very active dog. It's hard to find food with that much protein. We've been through the wringer for 3 years with our German Shepherd's food needs. He was diagnosed at 1 year old with IBD (inflammatory bowel disease) and even though he is on medication, we have to be careful because anything less than top quality food will give him terrible diarrhea (no matter how slowly and carefully we transition him from one food to another). Even some top quality foods will do it.Since we put him on Canidae Pure Sea he's had consistently firm stool for the first time in his 3 years of life. His coat has gotten more soft and glossy, his breath is good (for a dog), he's put on and kept on some much-needed weight. We are so happy! He's also a picky eater, but he loves the Canidae and never turns his nose up at it.<br /><br />A couple of notes for any dog-savvy readers: we ruled out EPI and protein sensitivities early on. He's on Tylan and Immodium for the IBD, and most likely will be for life. The vet said that no matter WHAT we do, he will likely be subject to bouts of diarrea. That's why the Canidae seems so miraculous.",Positive,per cent high quality protein great food young healthy active dog hard find food much protein weve wringer year german shepherd food need diagnosed year old ibd inflammatory bowel disease even though medication careful anything less top quality food give terrible diarrhea matter slowly carefully transition one food another even top quality food itsince put canidae pure sea he consistently firm stool first time year life coat gotten soft glossy breath good dog he put kept muchneeded weight happy he also picky eater love canidae never turn nose ita couple note dogsavvy reader ruled epi protein sensitivity early he tylan immodium ibd likely life vet said matter likely subject bout diarrea thats canidae seems miraculous

5,So far so good!,"Full disclosure: my doctor is one of the people responsible for bringing this product to market in the US. He had been telling me about monk-fruit based sweeteners for a few years prior to Nectresse being produced, so I was really excited to test out this sample.<br /><br />I've added this to berries and smoothies, so far, and all I can say is two thumbs up. No aftertaste, micro-granules dissolve quickly, and it's great to not be worrying about this being an artificial sweetener. Recently I thought I'd try cooking and baking with xylitol, let's just say there were mixed reactions to that. Xylitol, even in small amounts, can give you wicked bad gas. Nothing like that with Nectresse. I'm hopeful that they'll offer bulk quantities soon. Due to its concentrated sweetness, I imagine baking with it might present some logistical challenges, but if you've ever used stevia or any other non-bulking sweetener, then you already understand about that.",Positive,full disclosure doctor one people responsible bringing product market u telling monkfruit based sweetener year prior nectresse produced really excited test sampleive added berry smoothy far say two thumb aftertaste microgranules dissolve quickly great worrying artificial sweetener recently thought id try cooking baking xylitol let say mixed reaction xylitol even small amount give wicked bad gas nothing like nectresse im hopeful theyll offer bulk quantity soon due concentrated sweetness imagine baking might present logistical challenge youve ever used stevia nonbulking sweetener already understand

I decided then to order some from Amazon.  Lucky me! I chose Grama's Cherry Jelly and Grama's Cherry Jam, and my husband and I agreed that it was by far the best we'd ever tasted. The product is made with sour cherries, but the jam and jelly are sweet as can be.  If you like jam, Grama's is generous to include many pieces of luscious cherries.  They don't skimp. The jelly is clear as a jewel and tastes as good as homemade.<br /><br />I tried another brand of cherry jelly, and it was on the sour side.  It wasn't at all what you would like to spread on a hot piece of toast.  It is so nice to find a product that excels like Grama's does.

4,A Nice Combination,"When it comes to a body wash, I want something that's going to leave me clean and smelling better than I did when I took a shower.  But I don't want it to be so overpowering that other people flee the room when I enter.  I also want something that's on the masculine side of things and isn't overly floral.<br /><br />Enter the Dove Care for Men series.  I figured I'd give it a try and see how it works.<br /><br />So far, it's pretty good.  I swim laps a couple of times a week in a heavily chlorinated indoor pool.  So my first expectation is that the body wash would help remove that feeling of dryness and general chlorine-ness that can sometimes occur.  And it did that.<br /><br />The good thing is the dispenser on the top is large enough to get out enough but not so big that you're getting a ton more of the body wash then you need.  It allows for a greater degree of control and to use as little or as much as you need.  (I tend to err on the side of starting out with too little and getting more as needed rather than having too much).<br /><br />As for the scent, it's fairly subdued and not overpowering.<br /><br />A nice combination.",Positive,come body wash want something thats going leave clean smelling better took shower dont want overpowering people flee room enter also want something thats masculine side thing isnt overly floralenter dove care men series figured id give try see worksso far pretty good swim lap couple time week heavily chlorinated indoor pool first expectation body wash would help remove feeling dryness general chlorineness sometimes occur thatthe good thing dispenser top large enough get enough big youre getting ton body wash need allows greater degree control use little much need tend err side starting little getting needed rather muchas scent fairly subdued overpoweringa nice combination

The coffee grounds aren't like most coffee grounds, as they're fine as flour.  Like German's chocolate being smooth tasting like silk, so, too, is the taste of their coffee.

5,Great masala chai!,"I love this tea even though I can get all the ingredients from India and make my own masala chai. But this one has a special flavor and is organic! However, it is a little weak and does not give the full bodied tea experience of true Indian chai. So I mix strong black tea from India. Then boil some ginger before adding the tea in the water. Also, milk should always be added after the tea has boiled for a minute or so. When it all comes to the boil for the last time, add sugar/honey and strain. Boiling the tea without milk will give you more color and taste, otherwise it becomes too weak and milky.",Positive,love tea even though get ingredient india make masala chai one special flavor organic however little weak give full bodied tea experience true indian chai mix strong black tea india boil ginger adding tea water also milk always added tea boiled minute come boil last time add sugarhoney strain boiling tea without milk give color taste otherwise becomes weak milky

4,Bromley's Estate Blend (regular),"I began purchasing Bromley's Estate Blend Tea at Reny's in Maine after Red Rose went 'flat' on my palate.  The Bromley is labeled ""Superior Blend of Fine Black Teas"".  Bags are swirl-through (similar to Lipton tea bags).  The flavor of the Bromley is reminiscent of what Red Rose used to be - robust, bright and slightly astringent.  I drink it black but I'm told it stands up to milk well.  Color is a pleasing reddish-brown.  My only complaint is that the bags are packaged for commercial trade (i.e., each bag is individually-wrapped).  Bottomline: It's a great value for the money.  Also available at Ocean State Job Lots.(Note: This review refers to Bromley's Estate Blend Tea which is caffinated.)",Positive,began purchasing bromleys estate blend tea renys maine red rose went flat palate bromley labeled superior blend fine black tea bag swirlthrough similar lipton tea bag flavor bromley reminiscent red rose used robust bright slightly astringent drink black im told stand milk well color pleasing reddishbrown complaint bag packaged commercial trade ie bag individuallywrapped bottomline great value money also available ocean state job lotsnote review refers bromleys estate blend tea caffinated

4,Worth it for me,"I've had this for a couple of weeks now, and I love it.  If you don't want to spend the $, there are certainly cheaper ways to get the same end result -- fresh, healthy baby food.  However, I'm a working mom of two who is willing to spend some extra $ for convenience and for the assurance that I am not going to forget that I'm steaming veggies on the stove and leave it on so long that it ruins the organic food I just spent a bunch of money on!  The ease of use, from prep to clean up, is a big plus for me.  Plus, I make small batches, with different combinations every time, so my daughter is getting a better variety of foods on a weekly basis than when I made food for my son (I made large batches of food with the pot/steamer/blender combo for efficiency, and there was only so much room to store it, and only so much time to steam all of the different types of food).  I'm also more likely to make my own food on a consistent basis because of the convenience; in the couple of weeks I've had the Beaba, I've only reached for a jar one time in a pinch.  It takes up very little space as well.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product to someone who is willing to pay a bit more for some added convenience and ease of use.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the price tag, but I believe it's been worth it overall.  It seems like a quality product and seems well made.  If the price makes you cringe, just don't get it; you'll get by without it, for sure.  If not, and convenience is important to you, then I would recommend giving it a try.",Positive,ive couple week love dont want spend certainly cheaper way get end result fresh healthy baby food however im working mom two willing spend extra convenience assurance going forget im steaming veggie stove leave long ruin organic food spent bunch money ease use prep clean big plus plus make small batch different combination every time daughter getting better variety food weekly basis made food son made large batch food potsteamerblender combo efficiency much room store much time steam different type food im also likely make food consistent basis convenience couple week ive beaba ive reached jar one time pinch take little space welli would definitely recommend product someone willing pay bit added convenience ease use reason gave star instead price tag believe worth overall seems like quality product seems well made price make cringe dont get youll get without sure convenience important would recommend giving try

1,Does anyone know what REAL coconut water tastes llike?,"This product tastes terrible and it also tastes NOTHING like actual coconut water. Anyone who has ever lived in a country where Coconuts actually grow would be and IS utterly offended by this product. It seems that people will buy anything that is prepackaged and overly process as long as it claims to be all natural.

2,"great texture, but tastes terrible","Basicly LOOKS like bread, has the texture of bread - but it is really difficult to get past the fact that it tastes terrible.  Even with the best condiments to mask over the flavor, it shines through tasting something like fish, the smell of windex, dust and sugar.  Honestly.

They put their noses up at it). I don't see much difference between the with cheese and without cheese varieties and the dogs don't seem to care. This particular unit is two 25-ounce bags and we find that one bag lasts us approximately two to three weeks. We have two dogs and we give them treats, probably, two to four times a day depending on who's around.

3,$43.20 for 48 buds but only one bud is tasty and nice to look at,"I suggest ordering the pack with the small glass teapot with one each of 9 different flowering teas first.  Two disk and two balls are packed in each small box.  The ball ones open up in a cuter way.

5,Best dog entertaining device yet!,"I have a very energetic young dog who loves to chew but most bones and rawhides last no longer than 5 minutes.  This treat ball with one of the treats in each side lasted her days with hours of nonstop chewing until I would have to take it away for a while.  She loves it and so do I!  I will say, once there is only a little rim of the treat left along the side you may want to go ahead and take it away because I let her have it past that point and she sorta tore up the rim a bit that holds the treats in because she was trying to get the last bit out.  I think it will still work just fine though for hours more entertainment for her.  Great product!! By the way, for people who say it is dangerous or got destroyed by their dog here are 2 points to consider:<br />1. you should never let your dog chew on any treat or bone like this without supervision<br />2. yes this is a tough product, but some strong chewers will just naturally destroy anything that comes their way no matter how durable it is and that is something you should know about your dog.

5,Salt and Vinegar addict,"I'm not particularly health conscious, but when the general store on campus only had salt and vinegar (my favorite chip flavor) in the popchips brand, I figured I'd give these a try. To say that I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement. The texture, which is between a chip and a rice cake, is a bit thicker than usual but has a very satisfying crunch. It also helps the chips to keep from crumbling too easily. The sea salt and vinegar flavor is the perfect combination of salty and tangy, and while these are quite filling, I don't fill sick after I binge on a whole bag the way I would with ordinary chips. I never liked baked chips much (the texture was just off for me) but I think I might actually prefer these to ordinary potato chips.",Positive,im particularly health conscious general store campus salt vinegar favorite chip flavor popchips brand figured id give try say pleasantly surprised would understatement texture chip rice cake bit thicker usual satisfying crunch also help chip keep crumbling easily sea salt vinegar flavor perfect combination salty tangy quite filling dont fill sick binge whole bag way would ordinary chip never liked baked chip much texture think might actually prefer ordinary potato chip

5,Outstanding kibble,"I have a young adult male yellow lab that I've had for about a year (a rescue), and he gets lots of exercise through playing ball many times each day. I recently switched him over from Blue Buffalo Wilderness grain-free, which he liked a lot, to this food, which he absolutely loves (I think even more than the Blue Buffalo). I was initially attracted to this one because it's grain-free and much more reasonably priced that BB, and the rave reviews and comparable nutritional values convinced me to try it, and I'm very glad I did. Making the transition was easy--I fed a mixture of both foods for about a week, going from mostly BB to mostly Hi-Tek, and he had no digestive issues whatsoever in making the change. His stools are a bit darker than before, but also more well-formed, so cleanup is very easy. And most importantly, he's truly thriving with this food--has tons of energy, excellent muscle tone, and beautiful coat condition. The fact that it's also much more affordable is a great bonus, too. In short, I would recommend this food unconditionally.",Positive,young adult male yellow lab ive year rescue get lot exercise playing ball many time day recently switched blue buffalo wilderness grainfree liked lot food absolutely love think even blue buffalo initially attracted one grainfree much reasonably priced bb rave review comparable nutritional value convinced try im glad making transition easyi fed mixture food week going mostly bb mostly hitek digestive issue whatsoever making change stool bit darker also wellformed cleanup easy importantly he truly thriving foodhas ton energy excellent muscle tone beautiful coat condition fact also much affordable great bonus short would recommend food unconditionally

4,"Not a mocha, but good chocolate flavor","If I'm not looking for a full caff-kick out of my B60 brews, I usually put a teaspoonful of Quik powder into my cup after brewing, just to give it a hint of chocolate flavor (I was raised on the stuff, so go figure). After awhile I wondered if there was something out there that would give me the same taste without me having to dump the powder in. When I saw the Cafe Mochas at the local BB&B I couldn't resist buying a box.<br /><br />Ok, the good: Yummy, rich chocolate flavor (I never brew more than 8 oz., so I won't attest to the jumbo cup quantity); a welcome treat on cold days and/or nights.<br /><br />The bad: The coffee flavor is just barely there, if at all. It's almost imaginary, or maybe even psychological? A quick look into the K-cup will also show you that it's not even filtered---just straight up powder, really. It's only my discriminating chocolate buds that tell me that it's not simply hot cocoa. Well, maybe it is, but there's a little twist to it. So maybe that's the ""cafe"" part? =)<br /><br />Overall, if you're looking for a real Cafe Mocha, this isn't it.

5,Obese/overweight cat? Do your research!,"This is a really good choice for a nutritionally sound, lower calorie food, and our cat (admittedly not picky) immediately devoured it. But the real message here is: you need to find out how many kcal/day your cat needs for weight loss, research the calories in your cat's food, and accurately measure your feeding. There do not appear to be industry standards for what's labeled as 'weight management', 'light' etc., and the differences are dramatic!<br /><br />Our very young and energetic cat starting piling on weight from when he was a kitten. Maybe he stuffs himself because he's a 'rescue'--I don't know whether he might have had some starvation in his early weeks that marked him for life! but we had to put him on adult food before his kitten year was up, on the advice of our veterinarian--and he went on to gain weight up to almost 20 lb. even when giving the recommended daily amount of food, measured, divided into 2 daily feedings.<br /><br />We decided to switch from a Purina Pro Plan regular adult formula to their 'weight management' formula--still, kitty was gaining. When I finally did the research of how many kcal/day he should be getting and how many kcal we were giving him (mind you--the recommended, measured amount), I was shocked. The packaging recommends 56-84 g./day of the food for weight loss, for a cat with a goal weight of 10-14 lbs. That's 214-321 calories, measured by their own nutrition information. But my research at [...] showed that the recommended amount should be 187 calories/day for weight loss, for a goal weight of 10-12 lb. That means the *minimum* amount recommended by the Purina label was 27 more calories/day than he should be getting--or 14% more! and the maximum 'recommended' amount was 72% more than he should be getting for weight loss.<br /><br />[...] has a publication with calorie counts/cup of a wide variety of cat food: [...]<br />The range of calories/up is staggering. Anyone with an overweight cat--do your cat a favor and research how many calories/day they *should* be getting, and how many calories the 'recommended' amount that you're feeding actually is.<br /><br />After finding out how much of the Pro Plan Weight Management per day to offer, I thought our problems were over--I started giving him a daily amount with the right calories for weight loss. And he did start losing, at a slow but safe rate: about .2 lb/week. But he was constantly, frantically hungry. I looked further, for a nutritionally sound food that could give him more volume and fill him up while still not exceeding the calories he would need for weight loss. With the help of [...] for nutritional ratings, and the calorie chart on [...], I selected Science Diet Light--with approximately 75% of the calories per cup compared to the Purina Pro Plan. I can now give him 9g/day more, and I think the higher fiber content of this food will help him feel more full. While it does cost more than his previous food, the difference is not going to break the bank--I estimate it will cost me $4 more per month.",Positive,really good choice nutritionally sound lower calorie food cat admittedly picky immediately devoured real message need find many kcalday cat need weight loss research calorie cat food accurately measure feeding appear industry standard whats labeled weight management light etc difference dramaticour young energetic cat starting piling weight kitten maybe stuff he rescuei dont know whether might starvation early week marked life put adult food kitten year advice veterinarianand went gain weight almost lb even giving recommended daily amount food measured divided daily feedingswe decided switch purina pro plan regular adult formula weight management formulastill kitty gaining finally research many kcalday getting many kcal giving mind youthe recommended measured amount shocked packaging recommends gday food weight loss cat goal weight lb thats calorie measured nutrition information research showed recommended amount caloriesday weight loss goal weight lb mean minimum amount recommended purina label caloriesday gettingor maximum recommended amount getting weight loss publication calorie countscup wide variety cat food range caloriesup staggering anyone overweight catdo cat favor research many caloriesday getting many calorie recommended amount youre feeding actually isafter finding much pro plan weight management per day offer thought problem overi started giving daily amount right calorie weight loss start losing slow safe rate lbweek constantly frantically hungry looked nutritionally sound food could give volume fill still exceeding calorie would need weight loss help nutritional rating calorie chart selected science diet lightwith approximately calorie per cup compared purina pro plan give gday think higher fiber content food help feel full cost previous food difference going break banki estimate cost per month

3,Salt of the earth/sea,"I was not sure about the pepper factor with this product but decided to try it out.  The pepper seasoning was actually pretty good and a different twist on the usual cashew snack.  They went way overboard with the salt, however.  This really detracted from the overall quality.  If you are a big fan of very salty items, this is your snack.  If you normally prefer moderate, low, or no salt seasoning then you should pass on this one.

4,Not what I expected,"I never buy flavored coffee.  I'm a cream, sugar and drizzle of caramel sauce type of coffee drinker.

It, and the coffee smelled good.  My hubs wanted a cup, just black.  I brought him his and after he drank some, while I was brewing mine, I asked him how he liked the flavor.  ""What flavor?"" he asked.  ""It tastes like coffee to me"" he said.  More questions to him and he said all he tasted was coffee, no flavor and the coffee was ok.<br /><br />Now for my cup.  I used about 1 inch of milk, one spoon of sugar and the Keurig on medium brewing setting.  The same faint scent of toffee was there along with the coffee.  I took my first sip and hardly tasted any toffee flavor.  I looked at the k-cup and it said 'toffee' on it so it was the correct k-cups that were sent.  It is such a mild, almost non-existent flavor that I wouldn't hesitate to serve this to those who don't like flavored coffee, I'm sure they would like it.  I'm disappointed in the weak flavor of toffee but the coffee itself is good tasting so it's not a waste.  I'm used to extra-bold, dark/french roasts so this is a much lighter roast for me.

3,Homemade is better and cheaper,"I like Amy's products in general and these taste fine. although I like a heartier texture. At $2.27 per can (and that's on sale) I think the product is too expensive. It's so easy to make refried beans at home by frying and mashing a can of pinto beans and a can of kidney beans in a cast iron frying pan (use a little vegetable oil to fry then mash with a potato masher, adding bottled salsa to thin the mix and a pinch of cumin and chili powder for flavor).

5,The tastiest instant noodles EVER.,"Firstly I should start off by saying that I can not get enough of these noodles. They are a bit pricey where I live but much better than any other instant noodle bowls out there including any Simply Asia flavor. The Korean Sweet Chili is the best and only flavor I love or even like in the Annie Chun line.<br /><br />I find that there is a trick to heating it up. Using a pretty small whole cup of water, microwave, let sit with water for a minute and then drain it out by just leaving one corner slightly barely open while the rest of the lid is tightly closed turn it carefully upside down and it should be able to easily drain the water out with very little to no ingredients pouring out and less chance of burning hands. I also keep the same mini cup around filed with 1/4 cup of water to gradually pour in after the sauce is put in if I was too impatient to let the noodles soak in the water for a minute after microwaving.<br /><br />Another great thing about this noodle bowl is that it is vegan, so I don't have to worry about fish oils being used!",Positive,firstly start saying get enough noodle bit pricey live much better instant noodle bowl including simply asia flavor korean sweet chili best flavor love even like annie chun linei find trick heating using pretty small whole cup water microwave let sit water minute drain leaving one corner slightly barely open rest lid tightly closed turn carefully upside able easily drain water little ingredient pouring less chance burning hand also keep mini cup around filed cup water gradually pour sauce put impatient let noodle soak water minute microwavinganother great thing noodle bowl vegan dont worry fish oil used

5,Little Rainforest in my Kitchen,"Well, I have five of these gardens now, so obviously this is a product I've been very happy with.  I started out with tomatoes and salad greens, and the salad greens were so tasty I added a second garden of those and two strawberry gardens (the second one is on order).<br /><br />I have had no trouble with the pumps or noise, and everything has grown beautifully.  With five gardens going at once, it's so bright in that area of my kitchen that it looks like a UFO landing site, LOL, but they are all scheduled to go off at 11 p.m. so it's no problem at night when we're sleeping.<br /><br />These gardens are so cheerful to have around.  They add a nice moisture and a green, fresh smell, and I find the lights cheerful too.<br /><br />The salad greens grow very quickly and are so tasty that my biggest problem is resisting the urge to constantly pluck off leaves and eat them all day long.  That's why I got a second one -- so there would be plenty.  With four in my family, one garden did not produce quite enough for us.  Our first salad crop also did not grow for very long, only a couple of months, but I think that's just the nature of the plant.  The tomatoes took a long time to go to the fruiting stage (13 weeks), but now they are producing two or three ripe tomatoes each day, and they are delicious.<br /><br />I love having food growing indoors.  No bugs, no bird poop, no dirt, and everything can be eaten right off the plant.  Tonight over dinner we literally watched our first strawberry turn from white to pink on the end.<br /><br />No, this is not a particularly economical way to grow food, but it's loads of fun and has been educational and exciting for my kids, who are much more interested in fresh produce than they used to be.<br /><br />I've had no trouble with either the pumps or the customer service.  In fact, everyone at Aerogrow has been very kind and helpful, both over the phone and in e-mail.  I hope the company continues to thrive because I just love these little gardens and hope to use them for years.",Positive,well five garden obviously product ive happy started tomato salad green salad green tasty added second garden two strawberry garden second one orderi trouble pump noise everything grown beautifully five garden going bright area kitchen look like ufo landing site lol scheduled go pm problem night sleepingthese garden cheerful around add nice moisture green fresh smell find light cheerful toothe salad green grow quickly tasty biggest problem resisting urge constantly pluck leaf eat day long thats got second one would plenty four family one garden produce quite enough u first salad crop also grow long couple month think thats nature plant tomato took long time go fruiting stage week producing two three ripe tomato day deliciousi love food growing indoors bug bird poop dirt everything eaten right plant tonight dinner literally watched first strawberry turn white pink endno particularly economical way grow food load fun educational exciting kid much interested fresh produce used beive trouble either pump customer service fact everyone aerogrow kind helpful phone email hope company continues thrive love little garden hope use year
2,Good & Bad,"The good:<br /> - Good taste;<br /> - Pops up plump;<br /> - Convenient.<br /><br />The bad:<br /> - Lots of unpopped kernels (far more than any other brand I've used). You get plenty of popped corn, but it seems a waste and could lead you to question freshness or quality of the corn;<br /> - Uses the coal tar dyes Yellow #5 and #6 which have been implicated in various health issues and are listed as Group I carcinogens by the IARC.<br /> - The generic term ""natural and artificial color"" is used rather than listing actual flavor contents.<br /> - No ""best by"" or expiration date on the package<br /><br />For me the bad will prevent me from ordering more of this otherwise good popcorn. I don't need questionable additives just to make my popcorn yellow, and it leaves a colorful gross residue in the pan after popping. And for flavor, if the popcorn itself, along with whatever I want to add on my own, can't carry the day, I will find a product that can stand on its own.<br /><br />Other:  You only need 4 oz, or half this bag, to completely fill a standard Whirley-Pop so you can cut back as needed. Very salty for my taste, so you may want to start with much less than the salt offered and then salt to taste till you find the amount that works for you.",Negative,good good taste pop plump convenientthe bad lot unpopped kernel far brand ive used get plenty popped corn seems waste could lead question freshness quality corn us coal tar dye yellow implicated various health issue listed group carcinogen iarc generic term natural artificial color used rather listing actual flavor content best expiration date packagefor bad prevent ordering otherwise good popcorn dont need questionable additive make popcorn yellow leaf colorful gross residue pan popping flavor popcorn along whatever want add cant carry day find product stand ownother need oz half bag completely fill standard whirleypop cut back needed salty taste may want start much less salt offered salt taste till find amount work
4,Pamela's Ginger Snapz - 4 out of 5.,"I am allergic to wheat, soy, corn, and peanuts. I like the fact that this product wheat free, soy free, corn free, gluten free peanut free and to top everything off it's certified kosher. In my opinion the ginger snapz tasted good ... very 'snappy' - for lack of a better word. When you are allergic to the things I am allergic to you read the labels/ingredients of foods/snacks and you notice that pretty much everything contains SOMETHING that you are allergic to. So I am grateful for this product being made. I've read several reviews and I've noticed that most of the people who gave the ginger snapz a low rating kept saying they had a sandy taste. FYI: Look at the ingredients, it contains rice flour. Rice flour has a sandy/grainy type of feeling when eaten/felt. With that being said, I let my mom and my brother taste the ginger snapz. (Both of them aren't allergic to anything whatsoever). They said that it tasted good but it left a grainy/sandy after taste in their mouths. Once again, this product does contain rice flour. With that being said, remember people - this product has no wheat, soy, corn, or peanuts. I give credit where credit is due, they stripped some of the most common ingredients that people are allergic to and still ended up with an excellent tasting snack. 4 out of 5 because after I ate about 6 snapz and got over the actual feeling of me actually eating something that I wasn't allergic to *smiles* .. I did taste the sandy/grainy-ness that people were talking about. No complains though. I can make ice cream sandwiches now, no complains at all.",Positive,allergic wheat soy corn peanut like fact product wheat free soy free corn free gluten free peanut free top everything certified kosher opinion ginger snapz tasted good snappy lack better word allergic thing allergic read labelsingredients foodssnacks notice pretty much everything contains something allergic grateful product made ive read several review ive noticed people gave ginger snapz low rating kept saying sandy taste fyi look ingredient contains rice flour rice flour sandygrainy type feeling eatenfelt said let mom brother taste ginger snapz arent allergic anything whatsoever said tasted good left grainysandy taste mouth product contain rice flour said remember people product wheat soy corn peanut give credit credit due stripped common ingredient people allergic still ended excellent tasting snack ate snapz got actual feeling actually eating something wasnt allergic smile taste sandygrainyness people talking complains though make ice cream sandwich complains

3,Nice texture but not very sweet,"I just tried these for the first time and added in blueberries.  I found that the texture is tasty - somewhat like corn muffins - but the mix has very little sweetener in it, and didn't instruct to add any sweetening agent.  For that reason, I gave it 3 stars - b/c the taste isn't that great to me - but with some sugar, agave nectar or splenda, I think I would like these much better, and I'm going to try them again this weekend.  One other thing - I found that these do not form a rounded top like a ""normal"" muffin, for whatever that's worth.  When they bake, they do not flatten out on top or puff up, so if you wanted a more rounded top, you'll have to smooth them out in some way.  Still, I'm going to buy them again and try to modify to my taste.",Neutral,tried first time added blueberry found texture tasty somewhat like corn muffin mix little sweetener didnt instruct add sweetening agent reason gave star bc taste isnt great sugar agave nectar splenda think would like much better im going try weekend one thing found form rounded top like normal muffin whatever thats worth bake flatten top puff wanted rounded top youll smooth way still im going buy try modify taste

4,Easy and tasty,"Just to be clear- this is not authentic French onion soup.<br /><br />I've made the real thing- versions that require a few days and a lot of beef to make the stock, and those are delightful if one has the time and money and dedication.<br /><br />This kit is for when one does NOT have that time, money, and dedication. It also has some rather odd- as French onion soups go- but flavorful additions such as carrots and tiny lentils.<br /><br />However, when made up it is easy and very good; it does not taste like it was made from a mix; it does have a lot of onion flavor- rather the point of FOS; and the added ingredient list is not excessive (to my recollection, it calls for a sauteed sweet onion in butter, 6 cups low-sodium beef broth, apple juice, and Worcestershire sauce).<br /><br />I served it with gruyere toasts: pieces of italian bread, toasted, with gruyere melted onto them, as a nod to the classic ""croutons"",and my family liked it very much.<br /><br />Sauteed browned mushrooms would be an excellent addition, which I will do if I make this again!",Positive,clear authentic french onion soupive made real thing version require day lot beef make stock delightful one time money dedicationthis kit one time money dedication also rather odd french onion soup go flavorful addition carrot tiny lentilshowever made easy good taste like made mix lot onion flavor rather point fo added ingredient list excessive recollection call sauteed sweet onion butter cup lowsodium beef broth apple juice worcestershire saucei served gruyere toast piece italian bread toasted gruyere melted onto nod classic croutonsand family liked muchsauteed browned mushroom would excellent addition make

I have tried pretty much every flavor of every brand, and Zico in the tetra pak is the best, doesn't have the weird aftertaste that some of the other brands do.  I like mango and plain OK too, but the passion fruit is my favorite.  Coconut water is not for those who are used to strong, very sweet drinks, but if you're looking for a healthier, better tasting water this might be for you.  And though it's out of stock now, Zico says it will be back in distribution later in summer 2010.

4,"Zesty flavor, but watch the price!","I have bought more than six hundred of these at a discount store, and I have been eating them regularly.  It should be obvious that the only difference between the ramen flavors is the little flavor packets.  This flavor packet is a pretty zesty lime-citrus-salty flavor which is actually not as bad as you might think.  I usually use half the packet and throw in some curry and ginger, but that's just my preference.  Sometimes I will add a jalapeno or serano pepper that I sliced up into very thin pieces.<br /><br />So there must be many ways to enjoy ramen.  I only suggest that one watches the price.  I am happy to pay ten cents per packet at my discount store.  Otherwise it is seventeen cents at Walmart for chicken or beef flavor.

5,Great Stuff,"I was reading how healthy chocolate is. They all said dark chocolate was the best.

It reduces my morning caffeine intake because my brain turns on after my cocoa.<br /><br />They last for a long time. I bought two, and I've been working on my first one this whole time.

5,Fantastic Food for Good Cat Health,"The pet food industry can be one of the most infuriating as you start doing research and discovering what trash manufacturers (and the vets who get paid off by the manufacturers) push onto the unsuspecting public. For reference, don't ask your vet - do some Internet research at sites like, for example, [...]. What you'll find is that even the supposed ""high-end"" lines from basically every major supermarket label are horrible for your fuzzy friends. People who trust the marketing or trust their vets overpay and feed their cats foods that are full of carcinogens, cheap ingredients that are inappropriate for a cat's digestive system, and byproducts that provide nothing of value and are basically a way to make cheap profit off of literal garbage. It's a tragedy, as these same cats end up with shorter lifespans, kidney problems, UTIs, cancer, and a host of other issues, all of which could have been avoided by a high quality food.<br /><br />This is an A-Grade food. What you'll find here is very high protein content, many meat meals, good carbs and oils, and no grains, which is great as a cat is not an omnivore, it's a carnivore, and it simply does not need grains. It has 50 percent protein, which is among the highest you'll see in cat food. The first 4 ingredients are all meats.<br /><br />What you will NOT find here is the kind of junk you'll see in things like Purina One and Science Diet - byproducts (aka beaks, feathers, bird feet), brewers rice (aka the waste product from making beer), wheat flour (a leading cause of pet allergies), corn gluten (a cheap waste of space), and things like ""liver flavor"" (because they don't want to pay for the real thing). I didn't just pull those ingredients out of the air - I was reading the ingredients list of Purina One. It's pathetic.<br /><br />Don't feed your cats trash. Pay a little more to feed them good food now, and they'll lead longer, healthier, more satisfied lives as a result. It's worth it.",Positive,pet food industry one infuriating start research discovering trash manufacturer vet get paid manufacturer push onto unsuspecting public reference dont ask vet internet research site like example youll find even supposed highend line basically every major supermarket label horrible fuzzy friend people trust marketing trust vet overpay feed cat food full carcinogen cheap ingredient inappropriate cat digestive system byproduct provide nothing value basically way make cheap profit literal garbage tragedy cat end shorter lifespan kidney problem utis cancer host issue could avoided high quality foodthis agrade food youll find high protein content many meat meal good carbs oil grain great cat omnivore carnivore simply need grain percent protein among highest youll see cat food first ingredient meatswhat find kind junk youll see thing like purina one science diet byproduct aka beak feather bird foot brewer rice aka waste product making beer wheat flour leading cause pet allergy corn gluten cheap waste space thing like liver flavor dont want pay real thing didnt pull ingredient air reading ingredient list purina one patheticdont feed cat trash pay little feed good food theyll lead longer healthier satisfied life result worth
3,All Sugared Up With Noplace To Go,"I tried the Peanut Butter variety of Oreo Fudge Cremes, and they are definitely delicious- and RICH! When I first opened the pack, I was a little disappointed by what looked like a very meager number of cookies in the 11.3-ounce package.  The recommended serving size is 3 cookies.  Now, with a regular Oreo, I laugh at the regular serving size and proceed to obliterate an entire package in one or two sittings sometimes.  So I was ready to yell ""What a rip-off, Oreo!"" and be done with it.<br /><br />Then I tried a cookie.  I expected the fudge on the outside to be a little waxy and not very flavorful.  That's not the case with the Oreo Fudge Creme.  That fudge flavor was almost overpowering as I popped the whole cookie in my mouth - they're small enough to do that!  Then came the crunch of the thin Oreo, and the distinctive Oreo creme texture but VERY potent peanut butter flavor of the filling.  Imagine a piece of peanut butter creme pie with an Oreo crust exploding in your mouth, and that's close to the experience of these cookies.<br /><br />Back to my initial impression that Oreo's ripping us all off, putting so few of these cookies in a package.  People, it's a public service that they don't put more in.  At first I'd scoffed at the serving size, and while I had to try two of these cookies in pretty rapid succession (a conditioned response to an open package that says ""Oreo"" on it), I admit as I ate the third, I was slowed down considerably, more to a civilized three-bite per cookie pace.  That's when the richness and sugariness of the first two started hitting me.  I poured a glass of milk and enjoyed the rest of the third cookie, and had a fourth out of obligation to the remainder of my milk, and have decided that's the way to enjoy the Fudge Cremes- at least the Peanut Butter flavor- with a glass of milk.  I'd still rather have a package of original Oreo Cookies, or Double-Stufs, but I do like that the Peanut Butter Oreo Fudge Cremes encourage drinking a glass of milk, and I do think that three of them is quite a generous serving if you're enjoying a glass of milk and taking the time to enjoy each bite, instead of wolfing down a handful.  They're a fun treat I think even Cookie Monster would approve of... in moderation.",Neutral,tried peanut butter variety oreo fudge cremes definitely delicious rich first opened pack little disappointed looked like meager number cooky ounce package recommended serving size cooky regular oreo laugh regular serving size proceed obliterate entire package one two sitting sometimes ready yell ripoff oreo done itthen tried cookie expected fudge outside little waxy flavorful thats case oreo fudge creme fudge flavor almost overpowering popped whole cookie mouth theyre small enough came crunch thin oreo distinctive oreo creme texture potent peanut butter flavor filling imagine piece peanut butter creme pie oreo crust exploding mouth thats close experience cookiesback initial impression oreo ripping u putting cooky package people public service dont put first id scoffed serving size try two cooky pretty rapid succession conditioned response open package say oreo admit ate third slowed considerably civilized threebite per cookie pace thats richness sugariness first two started hitting poured glass milk enjoyed rest third cookie fourth obligation remainder milk decided thats way enjoy fudge cremes least peanut butter flavor glass milk id still rather package original oreo cooky doublestufs like peanut butter oreo fudge cremes encourage drinking glass milk think three quite generous serving youre enjoying glass milk taking time enjoy bite instead wolfing handful theyre fun treat think even cookie monster would approve moderation

They are the same, ""slim jim"" thickness as every other bully stick I've bought before.  I'm not even sure why they advertise them as thick.  The thickest one is MAYBE as big around as a dime.  Not at all what I expected, and I won't order them again. I kept them just because they are at least cheaper than the same size ones I can get at the store - and it's a pain to have to return them.  My 10 month old beagle consumed one in less than an hour, start to finish.  I was hoping to find something that would last longer than that!",Negative,hesitant purchase product reading review thick since couldnt find thick bully stick thought id give shot well disappointed thick slim jim thickness every bully stick ive bought im even sure advertise thick thickest one maybe big around dime expected wont order kept least cheaper size one get store pain return month old beagle consumed one less hour start finish hoping find something would last longer
1,These cookies are TERRIBLE!,"I love any good peanut butter cookie and thought this vendor, Nanas, looked to have pretty good reviews. But I'll tell ya... it's bland bland bland, tastes likes dried paste, horrible.

4,"Perfect, well almost.....if you don't mind sweetening.","I really want to like this cereal. It reminds me of the hot mush my grandma used to make which was a mixture of oatmeal, cream of wheat, and wheatena. The texture is excellent, not at all gluey like pure oatmeal. Mixed with maple syrup and yogurt I was very very pleased.<br /><br />However there is one problem you need to know. This cereal has a slight bitter aftertaste when you don't add anything to it or mix it with anything. I am not quite sure what it is due to, and I can't taste the bitterness if I mix it with a good amount of honey, or brown sugar, or butter or maple syrup. However if you like to eat your cereal without any sweetening added at all then I think it is not the right cereal for you.<br /><br />I think if you mix this hot cereal with other cereals it will improve their texture and you probably wont notice the aftertaste.",Positive,really want like cereal reminds hot mush grandma used make mixture oatmeal cream wheat wheatena texture excellent gluey like pure oatmeal mixed maple syrup yogurt pleasedhowever one problem need know cereal slight bitter aftertaste dont add anything mix anything quite sure due cant taste bitterness mix good amount honey brown sugar butter maple syrup however like eat cereal without sweetening added think right cereal youi think mix hot cereal cereal improve texture probably wont notice aftertaste

2,Residue kills it for me.,"Mrs. JS says:<br /><br />I have two main requirements for shampoo: lather well, and leave my hair clean with no residue. I also always hope for a shampoo that will calm my somewhat-frizzy curls into softness.<br /><br />While this shampoo was outstanding for the lather (really does a nice job there), it did leave a perceptible residue buildup in my hair after a few shampoos. (I do not use a conditioner.) I also didn't notice any impact on making my hair more manageable or softer looking, sadly.<br /><br />It has a coconut-y smell (maybe that's the shea?), and it does leave my skin nice and soft (I tend to use shampoo as a body wash as well), but since that's not enough I won't be running out to buy more.<br /><br />While Mr. JS says: as a guy, I review from a solid position of ignorant indifference. I say this shampoo feels good and makes nice lather. On second and third day not so much squeekiness from my hair; is that a residue thing? Maybe that's the ""nourish"" part.

5,Not as hot as was described in reviews but excellent sauce !,"This sauce is hot but no where near as hot as Chodruff talks about in his review. That was merely good storytelling rather than a truthful review of this sauce. The sauce has a very pleasant fruity tasty but not from any additives but rather from the natural taste of the ghost chili the main ingredient (although it has an odd smell like sweaty socks). Its no where near as hot as Dave's original insanity sauce. I can eat it a drop or two at a time on a corn chip or in a taco and the burn is moderate to hot but not crazy hot, whereas Dave's original insanity sauce would make a whole pot of chili burn with just a drop or two. This is one of my favorite sauces now. I bought a bottle a month ago and it is about 1/3 gone whereas Daves insanity lasted me years ( unless my tolerance is just growing ;-) ) Enjoy!!!",Positive,sauce hot near hot chodruff talk review merely good storytelling rather truthful review sauce sauce pleasant fruity tasty additive rather natural taste ghost chili main ingredient although odd smell like sweaty sock near hot daves original insanity sauce eat drop two time corn chip taco burn moderate hot crazy hot whereas daves original insanity sauce would make whole pot chili burn drop two one favorite sauce bought bottle month ago gone whereas daves insanity lasted year unless tolerance growing enjoy

I'm not sure if these are the same brand, but she offered me a few and I've always remembered them. They did come in a little tin and they were round and smooth, as these are.<br /><br />The taste is slightly violet and a little sweet.  In the middle there is a very tiny bit of licorice. It takes a while to get there though. Unless you have teeth like rocks, do not crunch down on these.

The sauce isn't really ""hot,"" but is loaded with flavor and has a snappy tang.

It's wonderful on meat, fish, fowl, and is great for marinade and more elaborate sauces.

I ordered 80 k-cups which is a great value.  I have no issues with the ""cupless"" k-cup. I also do not find the flavor ""burnt"" or ""bitter"" which I read in other reviews.

It is a very hearty tea, with a robust blend of flavors that go well with a wide variety of foods.<br />Scottish Breakfast Tea seems to pack a pretty good caffeine punch for me. I like the no-tag teabags that brew more than one 6-oz. cup, too. I can generally brew a gallon pitcher of iced tea on 6 bags, and I like my iced tea as dark as strong coffee.<br />I started ordering Scottish Breakfast Tea from Amazon when our local stores stopped carrying it.

3,Benriach Dark Rum finished is as light as a feather - perhaps too light,"I have a hard time believing Benriach 15 Dark Rum cask finished single malt whiskey is really aged 15 years. It's tow-headed pale yellow: among the lightest colored whiskey's I've ever seen. The aroma is nice - marshmallow, cake batter and butterscotch. With extended time a clear pineapple note comes to dominate the aroma. The pineapple and butterscotch aroma (pineapple upside down cake?) is yummy. On the tongue it is filigreed and lacy. Cerial honey, cake batter up front. There are some fruit esters at midpalate (apricot and sugar cane) and distant wood notes at the finish which is moderately short. My issue here is that there is too little oomph. What flavor there is here is nice - but there's a bit too little for my taste. Looking, smelling, and drinking this I would guess it has 8 years in the wood - not 15.",Neutral,hard time believing benriach dark rum cask finished single malt whiskey really aged year towheaded pale yellow among lightest colored whiskey ive ever seen aroma nice marshmallow cake batter butterscotch extended time clear pineapple note come dominate aroma pineapple butterscotch aroma pineapple upside cake yummy tongue filigreed lacy cerial honey cake batter front fruit ester midpalate apricot sugar cane distant wood note finish moderately short issue little oomph flavor nice there bit little taste looking smelling drinking would guess year wood

2,**********  READ THIS FIRST PLEASE ************,"First off, the initial arrival:  It came in a bigger box (since other things were ordered as well) when I opened it the 2 yellow bags set neatly and ready for me to eat!  Packaging, no other boxes or bags were used or necessary.  Review of the value: this is going to put it in perspective;<br />1) The average size bags are about 1.69 ounces<br />2) The larger size bags range from 9-11 ounces depending on which one as they make several.<br />3) This bag was just over 42 ounces and they go up to 60 ounces in certain packaging.<br />In theory you could go out and buy a bunch of the 1.69 ounce packages and to equal the total of about 84 ounces and at about $1 a bag you'd only buy about 48 bags at $.99 a bag it would be cheaper to go with these bags - however, the cost of this item was a little disappointing because I expected a little more in the bags.  Aside from a portion (probably 25% of the height) of the bag being air, I was just hoping for more M&M's.  Overall I give this purchase a C+ value as it was cheaper to buy this way.  But, as always beware of pricing for example another seller on Amazon charges $9.19 for the same bag (but you have to pay for shipping).  If you wanted to buy using Amazon Prime, like myself then you could get regular M&M's (no peanuts) for only $15.63 - about $10 less so that may be worth the savings.  An okay value - but at the end of the day it was cheaper than buying them individually. 73beats",Negative,first initial arrival came bigger box since thing ordered well opened yellow bag set neatly ready eat packaging box bag used necessary review value going put perspective average size bag ounce larger size bag range ounce depending one make several bag ounce go ounce certain packagingin theory could go buy bunch ounce package equal total ounce bag youd buy bag bag would cheaper go bag however cost item little disappointing expected little bag aside portion probably height bag air hoping mm overall give purchase c value cheaper buy way always beware pricing example another seller amazon charge bag pay shipping wanted buy using amazon prime like could get regular mm peanut less may worth saving okay value end day cheaper buying individually beat
4,Kyjen Dog Games Treat Wheel (Misc.),I have a 95lb pitbull/ mastiff mix that often loves his rope bone and his squeaker toy and thought it would be great to challenge him with some thinking toys.  I was a bit weary of this toy because my dog might chew up the plastic treat covers but found they are rather tough and that food incentive was greater than the chew incentive.  Overall it took about 10 minutes with the advice of the instructions and my pup was on his way to collecting treats from his new puzzle.  It takes him a few seconds now to pull the right cap off and start chowing on his goodies.  Another thing I would like to note is clean up is pretty easy.  I washed the tray and cups with hot water and soap and let dry next to the counter.<br /><br />This is a Social Writeup,Positive,lb pitbull mastiff mix often love rope bone squeaker toy thought would great challenge thinking toy bit weary toy dog might chew plastic treat cover found rather tough food incentive greater chew incentive overall took minute advice instruction pup way collecting treat new puzzle take second pull right cap start chowing goody another thing would like note clean pretty easy washed tray cup hot water soap let dry next counterthis social writeup

4,"Very strong flavor, but not bitter","I prefer my coffee black.  Usually, I turn to my Keurig for a great cup of rich black coffee.  However, the Dolce Gusto does a nice cup of unadorned coffee, as well.  The Caffee Lungo is, indeed, a very nice, naked coffee.  For my taste, though, it is a bit to strongly  flavored.  The frothiness is not altogether to my liking.  However, with a bit of milk and sugar the Lungo is very tasty, indeed.<br /><br />There are two ways to brew it.  The smaller cup is the ""Americano"" while the larger is the Caffee Lungo.  A frothy ""Americano"" seems a bit odd but it is tasty, if a bit to strong.<br /><br />Remember, the strength of the flavor is largely a result of a dark roasting.  A rule of thumb is the darker the roast the less caffeine in the  coffee.<br /><br />Anyway, the Dolce Gusto continues to impress me.",Positive,prefer coffee black usually turn keurig great cup rich black coffee however dolce gusto nice cup unadorned coffee well caffee lungo indeed nice naked coffee taste though bit strongly flavored frothiness altogether liking however bit milk sugar lungo tasty indeedthere two way brew smaller cup americano larger caffee lungo frothy americano seems bit odd tasty bit strongremember strength flavor largely result dark roasting rule thumb darker roast less caffeine coffeeanyway dolce gusto continues impress

The price for each packet is about the same as that of a normal clif bar, so I don't know if it's really worth it to me.

The caramel flavor is light and sweet and the fiber in these bars (a whopping 9g!) makes them a very filling snack or a quick meal on the go! I typically enjoy these in the afternoon to carry me through between lunch and dinner but have eaten them for breakfast on occasion as well and they keep me satisfied until lunch.

No artificial ingredients, preservatives or coloring, and it's sweetened with evaporated cane juice and molasses, and not the dreaded HFCS.  It's high in anti-oxidants, Omega-3s, and fiber, and is low in salt and fat. Best of all, it contains actual blueberry puree - very few of the foods sold as ""blueberry"" actually have any in it!<br /><br />Overall it's a very good choice for snacking or as cereal.  They need to put it in a box or some other container because my bag arrived with all the clusters broken into small pieces.

5,Marshmallows Are My Passion - Pumpkin Spice Is My Weakness!,"Marshmallows are my passion.  I love them so much.  I can eat them plain, in cereal, in coffee, in Rice Krispie treats, any way.  My favorite way to use these marshmallows is to drop two of them into the bottom of my cappuccino cup and pour in steaming espresso and steamed milk.  The marshmallows give the coffee drink just the right amount of pumpkin spice flavor.  I wish these were available all year round as I love anything pumpkin.  The flavor is the perfect amount of Pumpkin and Spice and not overly sweet.  I still have a bag left, but wish I would have ordered three times the amount.<br /><br />For Halloween, I made Pumpkin Spice Rice Krispie Treats and not only were they pretty, they were delicious.

I cannot say it was from this order of chicken chips but he got sick shortly after I started feeding him this order of chicken chips.  I had to pay a $500 vet bill when my dog had blood in his urine.  The vet could not determine what caused the urinary tract infection.

3,"Better than ""Miracle Noodles""","I have eaten the Miracle Noodles angel hair variety, prepared several ways, and could not tolerate the texture.  The Tofu Shirataki Noodles fettuccine has a much better texture.  The best use I have found is in Asian type soups, let the Tofu Shirataki noodles simmer a little while in the soup broth and they taste good. I do not like these noodles cooked in Italian recipes.

5,Gluten free with good taste,"The best gluten free mix I've tried.  Of the recipes on the box I can vouch for the pancakes and the waffles- the biscuits were edible if not enjoyable.  The pancakes and waffles also freeze well.  I also recommend Betty Crocker's ""Glutenfree Recipe Collection"" magazine for extra recipes to try with or without this mix. From the magazine I have thus far made the chicken and dumplings (the dumplings disintegrate a bit too easily but are still good) and the fruit swirl coffee cake (I used a full can of pie filling per 8X8- I used apple and lemon pie fillings.  I thought the cake tasted rather like a cobbler or dry danish pastry).  The mix is quick, it's easy, it tastes good, and it is versatile.  And hey- although the packaging of the mix into the little boxes is a bit of a pain it does serve to keep the mix fresh!",Positive,best gluten free mix ive tried recipe box vouch pancake waffle biscuit edible enjoyable pancake waffle also freeze well also recommend betty crockers glutenfree recipe collection magazine extra recipe try without mix magazine thus far made chicken dumpling dumpling disintegrate bit easily still good fruit swirl coffee cake used full pie filling per x used apple lemon pie filling thought cake tasted rather like cobbler dry danish pastry mix quick easy taste good versatile hey although packaging mix little box bit pain serve keep mix fresh
1,Not the same,"So I order my favorite Jim Beam seeds from Amazon every couple of months. I was running low so I decided to order a new case this week. To my dismay, the package that came in the mail has changed. The picture on Amazon still shows my favorite brand, but apparently Jim Beam seeds are now being produced by ""BIGS"". They changed the seed, as well as the amount of seasoning. The taste is the same, but not nearly as strong.<br /><br />Just a shame. The genuine original seeds were perfect. It wasn't just the taste, but the amount of flavor, as well as the quality of the seeds. Now we just have something simliar to a regular store-bought brand.<br /><br />I contacted Jim Beam and they verified they no longer have genuine seeds. They are all BIGS now, so my seed buying days on Amazon are over.

2,Possibly not the best solution,"One of my dogs had a bladder stone and needed surgery. After her surgery, the vet said to prevent the stones, she needed to be on Royal Canin Urinary SO for life. However, a year on the food and her small 12 lbs body (healthy weight) jumped to 19 lbs, which is obviously not healthy for her small breed frame. Her activity level did not decrease and there were no other lifestyle changes besides the food. Even though it prevented more stones, that much weight gain is really risky and dangerous, it could have lead to other health problems. Unhappy with my vet's suggestion to simply walk her more (she already gets 3 walks a day!)  I did my own research and spoke with a pet nutritionist (expensive but worth it). Well little did I realize that this food contains tons of fillers and inferior by-products! Main ingredients include pork by-products and corn grits! The nutritionist recommended that I switch her to a home cooked diet with supplements (multi-vitamin) and urinary health vitamins (cranberry, hydrangea, etc.) to prevent bladder stones and continue to have her urine checked at the vet on a regular basis. Two years later, she's lost the weight and has had no more stones! She also has more energy! Most of the time I cook for her and other times I give her Merrick canned dog food with her urinary vitamins.  I'm not saying this will work for everyone, but it certainly worked for my dog and I'm glad I didn't just accept this food as her fate and deal with the other health consequences that come along with being overweight. I would recommend that anyone with a dog who has issues with bladder stones to do their research and seek a second opinion about ways to deal with these health problems. Best of luck to you and your dog!",Negative,one dog bladder stone needed surgery surgery vet said prevent stone needed royal canin urinary life however year food small lb body healthy weight jumped lb obviously healthy small breed frame activity level decrease lifestyle change besides food even though prevented stone much weight gain really risky dangerous could lead health problem unhappy vet suggestion simply walk already get walk day research spoke pet nutritionist expensive worth well little realize food contains ton filler inferior byproduct main ingredient include pork byproduct corn grit nutritionist recommended switch home cooked diet supplement multivitamin urinary health vitamin cranberry hydrangea etc prevent bladder stone continue urine checked vet regular basis two year later shes lost weight stone also energy time cook time give merrick canned dog food urinary vitamin im saying work everyone certainly worked dog im glad didnt accept food fate deal health consequence come along overweight would recommend anyone dog issue bladder stone research seek second opinion way deal health problem best luck dog

4,I'm Not A Fan Of Oatmeal Cookies......,"...But these are pretty good! I generally steer clear of Oatmeal and Nuts in my Cookies (Give me a good old Chocolate Chip Cookie any day!), but these have a very nice Chocolate Chip taste, the Oatmeal taste is there, but it's not overpowering, and the Almonds didn't bother me very much. My only real complaint is in the packaging: The large box only contains 6 moderately-sized Cookies, which are individually-wrapped. The individual wrapping is good if you want to take a Cookie or two on the road with you, but when I saw the box my first thought was ""With a box that size, I'd expect more than six Cookies.""",Positive,pretty good generally steer clear oatmeal nut cooky give good old chocolate chip cookie day nice chocolate chip taste oatmeal taste overpowering almond didnt bother much real complaint packaging large box contains moderatelysized cooky individuallywrapped individual wrapping good want take cookie two road saw box first thought box size id expect six cooky

4,One Love Better Than It Smells,"One of the best things about a fine coffee is the aroma. It is part of the entire coffee drinking experience. It is the aroma that strikes you first with Marley Coffee - One Love. The coffee has a pungent, almost ""muddy"" odor. By ""muddy,"" I mean it actually smells like mud. This was the hardest thing to get past when trying this coffee. Next up is its light color. It almost brews with the color of a strong tea rather than a coffee. I like my coffee dark, so this was yet another hurdle I had to get past. Once I got to the taste, I was more than pleasantly surprised. The flavor was light, yet wonderfully smooth. There was not a lot of body to it, but it did taste great. This is a light roast at best. If that sounds like what you're looking for, go for it. I give it four stars on taste alone.

5,Great GingerSnap Flavor-- real fruit and nuts with NO JUNK,"These might be the best-tasting bars I've ever tried. They keep pretty well, too, although if you leave them in your car (in the heat) they will lose freshness will get hard quickly. They are great as a meal replacement when you don't have time for lunch and you need to grab something satisfying that won't spike your blood sugar and make you feel sick later on. This is a sustained energy-- I think it's the nuts that help it have a lasting energy feeling. The calories in these is always about 300, which is good for a meal replacement.<br /><br />I really love the ginger snap, which tastes just like a real gingersnap cookie and you can taste the real ginger.

4,Strong Dark Roast Coffee,"This is about the strongest K cup I've purchased.  I like my coffee strong, and before buying a K cup coffee maker, always purchased French roast whole bean and brewed strong coffee.  Brewing this in a K cup machine at an 8 ounce cup will definately provide you with a strong cup of coffee.  Since I brew a cup for my wife and I at the same time, I run two 8 ounce cups with one of these K cups into a small decanter, and then pour into two coffee cups, which still yields a strong flavor, but not enough pop your eyeballs out...<br /><br />Of course, brewing two cups with one K cup drops the price down in half, which at less than thirty cents a cup is on the cheap end of K cup brewing.  I find most K cups are good for up to a 12 ounce cup, and 16 ounces would weaken them too much...  But this works for my wife and I since I have been fixing a cup for each of us for years, and brewing two cups with one K cup is economical.",Positive,strongest k cup ive purchased like coffee strong buying k cup coffee maker always purchased french roast whole bean brewed strong coffee brewing k cup machine ounce cup definately provide strong cup coffee since brew cup wife time run two ounce cup one k cup small decanter pour two coffee cup still yield strong flavor enough pop eyeball outof course brewing two cup one k cup drop price half less thirty cent cup cheap end k cup brewing find k cup good ounce cup ounce would weaken much work wife since fixing cup u year brewing two cup one k cup economical
5,Classic Cookies,"All of the flavors I've tried are great; but my favorite are the mint.<br /><br />I was concerned re the shipping issue based on other reviews.  When they arrived, the cookies were packed so tightly into a box filled with canned goods that the outer carton was pushed out of shape right on top of where the cookies were - which carton was pretty battered on that location, as one might expect from an incorrectly packed carton.  Amazon, what is up with your packaging logic?  It's so weird what you do when packing things....<br /><br />Anyway, I figured the whole batch of cookies would be crushed.  To my amazement, only 3 of the cookies were broken (out of a pack of 4 bags).  I think that was a fluke really.  Anyway, otherwise they were fresh etc.  The only other odd thing was that these seemed to be different cookies than what I was used to.  They seemed to be thinner.  I've noticed since moving from the West Coast to the East Coast that a lot of products seem different here in various ways, so I figured it was either that, or maybe I was imagining it; but I don't think so.  Anyway - I actually preferred the thinner ones, as the overall flavor balances were better and the texture was more appealing.<br /><br />So while my shipping story was a success, I can't claim that the product was really properly packaged, and I wouldn't therefore want to leave a review claiming that.",Positive,flavor ive tried great favorite minti concerned shipping issue based review arrived cooky packed tightly box filled canned good outer carton pushed shape right top cooky carton pretty battered location one might expect incorrectly packed carton amazon packaging logic weird packing thingsanyway figured whole batch cooky would crushed amazement cooky broken pack bag think fluke really anyway otherwise fresh etc odd thing seemed different cooky used seemed thinner ive noticed since moving west coast east coast lot product seem different various way figured either maybe imagining dont think anyway actually preferred thinner one overall flavor balance better texture appealingso shipping story success cant claim product really properly packaged wouldnt therefore want leave review claiming

This chili paste just brought out the flavor of the vegetables and added some umph to them. If you like spicy foods, then you should try adding some of this chili paste to your vegetables.

4,All cans intact,"After reading other reviews I was concerned about ordering this, expecting that the cans may arrive damaged, however they were all in perfect condition. The cans were all packed tightly in a box, which was then placed within a second box for delivery. As for the product itself, I had been using a coconut milk from a carton that was smooth and did not separate. This coconut milk separates into the coconut water and coconut cream, so when the can is opened, the harder coconut cream is on top and the water is underneath. Since I only use 1 serving at a time (1/4 cup) this means dividing the cream and coconut water separately. I tried blending it in a blender but it still did not blend together. The taste is comparable to other coconut milks I have tried.",Positive,reading review concerned ordering expecting can may arrive damaged however perfect condition can packed tightly box placed within second box delivery product using coconut milk carton smooth separate coconut milk separate coconut water coconut cream opened harder coconut cream top water underneath since use serving time cup mean dividing cream coconut water separately tried blending blender still blend together taste comparable coconut milk tried

3,The taste just wasn't there for me,"I consume vitamin drinks pretty regularly. I just couldn't get into the taste of this product.

Just like all Heinz® Ketchup varieties, it contains no artificial colors, flavors or preservatives.""<br /><br />Notice something?? They dont mention that they replace sugar with sucralose; a chlorinated sweetener (chlorine has a byproduct dioxin which the EPA found to be 300,000 times as carcinogenic as the pesticide DDT.-mercola)<br /><br />When i wrote Heinz to suggest they print ""artificially sweetened"" below their massive 'reduced sugar banner' their response to me was search for the fine print on the back of the bottle.

Too many products labelled as spicy are not, have no kick, and are as bland as can be. Here, you do get a slow noticeable burn from the jalapeno. My preference? A bit more heat. But I understand that most consumers would prefer somewhat less than I would.

1,They changed the Chips now they taste horrible,"I once loved these chips and they were the only chips i would buy.  I discovered them when I was in England back in 2000 and quickly became a fan.  About a year ago I picked up a bag that was on sale at my local supermarket.  I was finding it odd that they were on sale so much but took advantage of it.  After opening the bag I found the chips were not even close to the Kettle chips I was used to.  They were all uniform whitish yellow in color, flavor was way off, the lovely extra crisp brown chips were gone completely and I was very disappointed.  So I e-mailed Kettle with the following:  ""What Happened? I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste; It tastes ""cheaper"". I don't know how else to put it... I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor. I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product. Did I just get a weird batch? I have been buying only Kettle Chips for about 10 years now so I am wondering.""  I did receive a reply: ""Thanks for letting us know about your experience with your Kettle Brand® Chips. It sounds like you may have received a bag that should not have slipped by our inspections, and we apologize.Our potatoes do vary seasonally which could account for a variation in color-but our chips should still taste great!Thanks for providing us with the ""best before"" code from the bag.  This really helps when passing on your comments to our staff.<br />We are sending some coupons to replace your purchase with any of our Kettle Brand® flavors or nut butters, believing you will have a great experience with your next purchase! In case you buy this product again, we suggest avoiding the same best before date (if you still have it) in the rare instance another bag from the same case slipped by our inspections at the same time.<br />Thanks again for letting us know about this and expect the coupons to arrive within 3 weeks.  Please let me know if I can be of any more help.""  Well the next bag was good.  Since that time I have picked up 3 bags of chips all were like the ""bad"" bag so I am pretty sure that they have changed there product to reduce cost.  I did some research and found out that Kettle was bought out by a private equity company.  So the same cookie cutter management processes are probably being employed at Kettle.  Acquire company with high quality brand recognition, sell product to mass merchants, lower quality/cost of product to increase margin and finally sell company just before the customer base starts to realize that the brand is no longer a quality brand.  increased profits make the company more valuable on paper so they make a nice profit for the investors. Customer and employees lose out of course as does an unsuspecting buyer of the exploited brand.

5,Great cat food,"My old cat who died last year had diabetes because I didn't understand the basic principles of feline nutrition.  After he was diagnosed, I switched him to a canned food diet with multiple small feedings per day, and that was actually enough to get him off insulin!<br /><br />Although I would have done anything to prevent his diabetes, I didn't appreciate how unfussy it made him until he died and I got another cat.  The old cat would eat anything.  The new cat would starve himself to death before he'd eat something that doesn't meet his standards.<br /><br />Unfortunately, he's particularly fussy about canned food.  He doesn't like pate-style or ground foods - if I even want there to be a prayer of him eating it, it has to have shredded meat.  That's why I was so pleased to discover this brand.<br /><br />First of all, I love the ingredient list.  The foods are balanced and grain-free (so important!) and don't contain unnecessary chemicals or preservatives.  The only ingredient I'm less than thrilled about is the tapioca starch (used for thickening), but it's listed after the protein sources I really don't worry about it.  When I was first considering this brand, I checked out reviews for it on other websites, and there were a lot of people upset that some of the flavors contain menadione.  I looked into this, and it's a form of vitamin K which is an essential additive in fish-based foods because they don't contain enough natural vitamin K and it's required for health.  The controversy appears to be based in that it was banned for humans...after a bunch of babies died when they were given great big whopping doses.  Fortunately, the amount of menadione added is so minuscule that I'm totally comfortable with its inclusion.  (And since it's not present in the chicken-based formulas, and since I think poultry is a better staple food for cats than fish, he gets that much less of it.)<br /><br />Actually, the chicken and pumpkin flavor seems to be his favorite.  I was a little unsure of using pumpkin, since cats are carnivores and carbohydrates can have some bad effects, but it's apparently good for their digestion.  Since I rotate the different flavors, the possible consequences are really reduced...and since cats seem to like to barf just to keep things interesting, I'm pleased about any possible stabilizing effect!<br /><br />Soulistic's website also promises to use human-grade ingredients.  No by-products here!  It even smells like regular people food, which, let me tell you, is a welcome relief.<br /><br />But the best part: the cat loves it.  He doesn't refuse it, he's not even merely indifferent to it - he devours it.  I've tried every single flavor of the ""in gravy"" flavors (I haven't tried the ""in gelee"" flavors) and every single one of them sends him into raptures.<br /><br />Seriously, it doesn't get any better than this.  There's a canned grain-free cat food with a high moisture content and shreds or chunks of real meat and fish as the first ingredients, and the cat loves it.  There are enough flavors to give him variety, both in taste and nutrition.  I'm sold!",Positive,old cat died last year diabetes didnt understand basic principle feline nutrition diagnosed switched canned food diet multiple small feeding per day actually enough get insulinalthough would done anything prevent diabetes didnt appreciate unfussy made died got another cat old cat would eat anything new cat would starve death hed eat something doesnt meet standardsunfortunately he particularly fussy canned food doesnt like patestyle ground food even want prayer eating shredded meat thats pleased discover brandfirst love ingredient list food balanced grainfree important dont contain unnecessary chemical preservative ingredient im less thrilled tapioca starch used thickening listed protein source really dont worry first considering brand checked review website lot people upset flavor contain menadione looked form vitamin k essential additive fishbased food dont contain enough natural vitamin k required health controversy appears based banned humansafter bunch baby died given great big whopping dos fortunately amount menadione added minuscule im totally comfortable inclusion since present chickenbased formula since think poultry better staple food cat fish get much less itactually chicken pumpkin flavor seems favorite little unsure using pumpkin since cat carnivore carbohydrate bad effect apparently good digestion since rotate different flavor possible consequence really reducedand since cat seem like barf keep thing interesting im pleased possible stabilizing effectsoulistics website also promise use humangrade ingredient byproduct even smell like regular people food let tell welcome reliefbut best part cat love doesnt refuse he even merely indifferent devours ive tried every single flavor gravy flavor havent tried gelee flavor every single one sends rapturesseriously doesnt get better there canned grainfree cat food high moisture content shred chunk real meat fish first ingredient cat love enough flavor give variety taste nutrition im sold

2,No better than Wilton,"I bought this set mainly for the red.  I bake and decorate with frosting/icing quite a bit, so I was excited to get so many colors that were supposed to be of better quality than Wilton.  I used an entire bottle of red in 3 cups of buttercream frosting.  The darkest it would get was a watermelon color.  By the time I got to that point, my frosting had broken and looked terrible.  The royal blue wasn't much better.  The only reason I didn't give it one star is because I haven't used all of the colors yet, just red and blue.  I will stick with store bought red frosting and Wilton gel colors for everything else.",Negative,bought set mainly red bake decorate frostingicing quite bit excited get many color supposed better quality wilton used entire bottle red cup buttercream frosting darkest would get watermelon color time got point frosting broken looked terrible royal blue wasnt much better reason didnt give one star havent used color yet red blue stick store bought red frosting wilton gel color everything else

3,Totonics Mexican Vanilla,The price was right; a bulk order is convenient rather than purchasing small portions. Accomodations to flavor must be made. It is not like any other vanilla I have used.

Later discovered the same lentils much more reasonably priced in the aisle with the Mexican food.",Neutral,tired paying dal local gourmet grocery homebound travel indian part town bought online later discovered lentil much reasonably priced aisle mexican food
1,People are crazy,This is horrible! DO NOT BUY! This coffee tastes nothing like something from Maui nor has it sat even near to a vanilla bean or any kind of nut! You'd be better off buying foldger's or maxwell house. It was over roasted\scortched and ground way too fine. I cant believe anyone liked this at all! I have to believe the positive reviews are from friends and relatives. what a waste of my money.,Negative,horrible buy coffee taste nothing like something maui sat even near vanilla bean kind nut youd better buying foldgers maxwell house roastedscortched ground way fine cant believe anyone liked believe positive review friend relative waste money
5,Yummy,"Fabulous cookie.  Perfect size.  Love packaging.  No more stale cookies.  Senior size, just enough with a cup of coffee (or tea) for a snack.  Wish all food was like that.",Positive,fabulous cookie perfect size love packaging stale cooky senior size enough cup coffee tea snack wish food like
5,Great Snack for the whole family!!,Everyone in my family loves these. The are a cross between a twizzler and a fruit snack. They come individually wrapped so they are easy to take on the go or throw into lunches. There are 70 calories per package. Which isn't to bad since they are pretty chewy and fun to eat.  I would recommend these to friends and family. They are a treat you can feel good about eating.,Positive,everyone family love cross twizzler fruit snack come individually wrapped easy take go throw lunch calorie per package isnt bad since pretty chewy fun eat would recommend friend family treat feel good eating

5,Amazing tasty yellow tomato puree,"An excellent tasting tomato puree, quite unusual as it is made from yellow and not red ones.  It had a wonderful sweet taste, less acidity than a red puree.  It made an outstanding sauce that was great on ravioli.  Additionally, I used it as the sauce for a lasagna, resulting in an unusual dish both by taste and visually.  I highly recommend this product it you want to stray from the mainstream of typical red sauces.",Positive,excellent tasting tomato puree quite unusual made yellow red one wonderful sweet taste less acidity red puree made outstanding sauce great ravioli additionally used sauce lasagna resulting unusual dish taste visually highly recommend product want stray mainstream typical red sauce

5,"Nice flavor, not too sweet.","This is nice different tea. It is not too sweet but flavorful. Although it says Blackberry Vanilla, neither flavor is overwhelming. It brews readily and you can actually get probably a cup and a half from one teabag. I really like the new tea bags that seem to get the flavor out quicker than the old style teabags. I probably won't buy this tea as I prefer the regular tea as it has a stronger flavor. This tea would be nice for someone looking for a flavorful non-caffeinated tea.",Positive,nice different tea sweet flavorful although say blackberry vanilla neither flavor overwhelming brew readily actually get probably cup half one teabag really like new tea bag seem get flavor quicker old style teabags probably wont buy tea prefer regular tea stronger flavor tea would nice someone looking flavorful noncaffeinated tea
3,"Good, but not my favorite","I like strong, but smooth coffee. This coffee is strong enough, but a little on the bitter side for my taste. I have tasted other strong blends that I like much more. My husband, who likes a medium roast coffee, is OK with this coffee, but it not his favorite either. I would only recommend it to someone who likes a little tang in their morning cup of joe.",Neutral,like strong smooth coffee coffee strong enough little bitter side taste tasted strong blend like much husband like medium roast coffee ok coffee favorite either would recommend someone like little tang morning cup joe
5,Great product,Pb 2 is good in smoothies or baking when you want a PB flavor without the fat.  It's low in calories and still has enough protein and other  nutrients after the processing.  I would prefer to have no sugar added or at least substitute the sugar with Stevia.  Otherwise it is a really useful and good tasting product.,Positive,pb good smoothy baking want pb flavor without fat low calorie still enough protein nutrient processing would prefer sugar added least substitute sugar stevia otherwise really useful good tasting product
5,"Great Tasting Tea, Very Economical","This is an unbelievable deal. For the same price as the mystery cube o' leaves you find at Asian grocers or internet vendors, you get a full pound of Organic leaves. The Gunpowder Green has a hint of citrus, a hint of nuttiness, but most importantly, it tastes clean. You don't have to worry about undoing the health benefits of green tea with heavy metals or other pollutants in non-organic products. The 16 Oz. bag lasted me over two months with several strong cups per day. I highly recommend this tea.",Positive,unbelievable deal price mystery cube leaf find asian grocer internet vendor get full pound organic leaf gunpowder green hint citrus hint nuttiness importantly taste clean dont worry undoing health benefit green tea heavy metal pollutant nonorganic product oz bag lasted two month several strong cup per day highly recommend tea
5,Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf,"Emeril's Jazzed Up Decaf K-Cup's are great. Probably the best cup of decaf I have ever had, no kidding.  I have had many different kinds of Decaf. The only problem is that it is so good it makes me want to drink more than I usually do so there goes more money but well worth it!!! :-)",Positive,emerils jazzed decaf kcups great probably best cup decaf ever kidding many different kind decaf problem good make want drink usually go money well worth
5,Teeccino,"I have tried quite a few coffee substitutes, this one isn't just for a sub.  It actually has very healthful things in it, and is caffine free, has antioxidents in it and even has elimination assistance.  We don't drink it because of lower acid (it is actually alkaline)it also helps with acid stomic, I have even been able to avoid taking zantac for a while.  It also gives a natural energy boost, it isn't difficult to get accustomed to the favor, you just can't expect it to taste exactly like coffee, pero is actually closer to coffee flavor if that's what you're looking for.  Beware of Yerba Mate, I checked it out, it is extremely high in caffine and price.",Positive,tried quite coffee substitute one isnt sub actually healthful thing caffine free antioxidents even elimination assistance dont drink lower acid actually alkalineit also help acid stomic even able avoid taking zantac also give natural energy boost isnt difficult get accustomed favor cant expect taste exactly like coffee pero actually closer coffee flavor thats youre looking beware yerba mate checked extremely high caffine price
5,Perfect for stuffing in the Kong toys,Kong Stuff'N Snacks make a perfect stuffer for the Kong Classic Dog Toy. Much better and less messy than peanut butter. Keeps the dogs occupied for at least 20 minutes or longer. And the dogs love 'em! Just wish they were a tad cheaper or had more in the package.,Positive,kong stuffn snack make perfect stuffer kong classic dog toy much better less messy peanut butter keep dog occupied least minute longer dog love em wish tad cheaper package
1,Terrible. Just terrible,"This stuff is nasty. It's the most fakest tasting queso I've had in a long time. You get what you pay for. It's cheap and it tastes like it. I like Taco Bell branded taco and fajita sauces, so I thought it was worth a shot. It was not. Just gross. Took one bite and threw it out.<br /><br />The crazy thing is the label says its made with Kraft cheese. Kraft should cancel this cross-branding immediately. It makes them look bad. They must put a piece of Kraft in with a bunch of cheese-flavored gunk.",Negative,stuff nasty fakest tasting queso ive long time get pay cheap taste like like taco bell branded taco fajita sauce thought worth shot gross took one bite threw outthe crazy thing label say made kraft cheese kraft cancel crossbranding immediately make look bad must put piece kraft bunch cheeseflavored gunk
3,Amazing bar! Too expensive @ amazon!,Why is the box of 10 $10 @ Amazon when I can buy this for $4 at the grocery store? Is there a pricing problem?,Neutral,box amazon buy grocery store pricing problem
4,BOB MARLEY WOULD LIKE THIS I THINK,"I liked the smooth, rather mild flavor of this One Love, One Heart, 100% Ethiopian Yirgacheffe bean. My only complaint is the single packets with no instructions anywhere.  I assume the packets are for a single cup brewer.  I cut open the packets and used several in a multi cup brewer.  I wish there was a number to call.  Beautiful packaging and an excellent flavor.  Wonder if there's an instant version as well as packaging as beans and ground.  In my limited experience, I think Ethiopian coffee ranks among the very best of natural coffee flavors.  I bet even Bob Marley would like this along with his morning ganga.<br /><br />""...let's get together and feel all right""  Indeed.",Positive,liked smooth rather mild flavor one love one heart ethiopian yirgacheffe bean complaint single packet instruction anywhere assume packet single cup brewer cut open packet used several multi cup brewer wish number call beautiful packaging excellent flavor wonder there instant version well packaging bean ground limited experience think ethiopian coffee rank among best natural coffee flavor bet even bob marley would like along morning gangalets get together feel right indeed

5,Tastes great!,"I have a Waring Pro, and this stuff is fantastic. It is salty and buttery, and tastes like movie theater popcorn. Some complain it doesn't all pop, that's because some of the kernals are thrown out of the kettle while the others pop. It always fills the tray that comes with my popper all the way up. I love it.",Positive,waring pro stuff fantastic salty buttery taste like movie theater popcorn complain doesnt pop thats kernals thrown kettle others pop always fill tray come popper way love
5,Tasty and filling!,"Healthy Choice used to be a byword for mediocre diet food. During the last few years, however, they've gotten better and better, producing tasty grub at reasonable prices and with some real health advantages over things like, say, Banquet TV dinners.<br /><br />This latest product, a tasty Ziti with meat sauce, is a little different from some of their others. First, it doesn't need freezing. Second, you cook the pasta by dumping in water, nuking it and then straining it through the nifty little strainer lid! This makes it ideal for a compact lunch you can take to work. All you need is some water and a microwave and happiness will ensue!<br /><br />As far as the taste goes? I was surprised! The pasta came out nice and tender and there was a good mix of flavors in the meat suace as well as some chunks of what I really hope were actually meat. Even better, someone who likes to eat large, I'll tell you this actually left me nice and full and not feeling like I needed to eat anything else right away.<br /><br />Very good product.
